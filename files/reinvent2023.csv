The Agent now supports writing feature flags and configuration data to a file on local disk in a location that the customer specifies. Secondly, to improve resiliency, the Agent can be configured to write its own local backup of the latest version of configuration data, and use that backup if there is a network issue or outage that prevents the Agent from reaching the AWS AppConfig service. Also, the Agent now allows engineers to test configuration changes in their local environments. Finally, this version of the Agent allows a customer to map different AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions for different Configuration Profiles, which enables fine-grained security for configuration data.</p>

Using FreeRTOS OTA libraries, you can quickly build connected products capable of seamlessly processing remote firmware update tasks, thus allowing you to manage and maintain your device fleet to be up to date. With the new update, you can now configure FreeRTOS open source OTA libraries in small batches for better flexibility as compared to using a large library that may require base-code modification. For example, to retain operational integrity and continuity of your deployed IoT devices, you can now configure your modular FreeRTOS libraries to first require the device to be in a ‘safe’ or ‘commissioning’ mode and only then accept and process software update messages. </p>

Amazon Q in Connect delivers real-time recommendations that help contact center agents resolve customer issues quickly and accurately, helping improve both agent productivity and customer satisfaction. This generative AI assistant, which includes functionality formerly available as Amazon Connect Wisdom, can help agents detect customer intent during calls and chats using conversational analytics and natural language understanding (NLU), then provides agents with generated responses and suggested actions, along with links to relevant documents and articles. For example, Amazon Q can help detect that a customer is contacting a rental car company to change their reservation, generate a response for the agent to quickly communicate how the company’s change fee policies apply to this customer, and guide the agent through the steps they need to update the reservation. In addition to receiving recommendations, agents can also query Amazon Q using natural language or keywords to answer customer requests. Amazon Q is built into the Amazon Connect agent workspace and is available via API for your own agent desktop.<br>

Agents can plan and perform business tasks, such as answering questions about product availability or taking orders. Customers can create an agent in just a few clicks by writing a few instructions in natural language, providing access to the company’s systems, and defining AWS Lambda functions. Agents analyze the user request and break it down into a logical sequence using the FM’s reasoning capabilities to determine what information is needed, the APIs to call, and the sequence of execution to fulfill the request. After creating the plan, Agents call the right APIs and retrieve the information needed from company systems and data sources to provide accurate and relevant responses. Agents automatically perform this process in the background—securely by encrypting data in transit and at rest—each time. This relinquishes customers from having to engineer prompts, train models, or manually connect systems. With Agents for Amazon Bedrock, customers can easily integrate generative AI into their businesses, simplifying and accelerating how they perform and execute tasks without the undifferentiated heavy lifting.</p>

Before we enable FLOAT data type, SPICE only supports FIXED decimal data type. FIXED decimal data type provides the benefit of exact mathematical operations, but since it only supports four decimal places, and rounding while ingesting data and performing calculations, it causes accuracy and overflow problems. The new FLOAT, i.e. floating-point numeric data type, provides approximately 16 significant digits of accuracy. These significant digits can be on either side of the decimal point, thus allowing numbers with more accuracy as well as larger range. If users are working with very small numbers (close to zero), they can use approximately 15 digits to the right of the decimal point. This helps avoid the problem of truncation and is consistent with other products’ results. Additionally, with a maximum value of approximately 1.8*10^308, the possibility of an overflow error is effectively minimized. SPICE has added this data type without sacrificing performance, so customers can continue to experience the same super-fast performance they’ve come to expect.
