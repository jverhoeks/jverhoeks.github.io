<h4 id="amazon-bedrock-guardrails-now-supports-automated-reasoning-checks-preview">Amazon Bedrock Guardrails now supports Automated Reasoning checks (Preview)</h4>
<p>With the launch of the Automated Reasoning checks safeguard in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, AWS becomes the first and only major cloud provider to integrate automated reasoning in our generative AI offerings. Automated Reasoning checks help detect hallucinations and provide a verifiable proof that a large language model (LLM) response is accurate. Automated Reasoning tools are not guessing or predicting accuracy. Instead, they rely on sound mathematical techniques to definitively verify compliance with expert-created Automated Reasoning Policies, consequently improving transparency. Organizations increasingly use LLMs to improve user experiences and reduce operational costs by enabling conversational access to relevant, contextualized information. However, LLMs are prone to hallucinations. Due to the ability of LLMs to generate compelling answers, these hallucinations are often difficult to detect. The possibility of hallucinations and an inability to explain why they occurred slows generative AI adoption for use cases where accuracy is critical.<br> <br> With Automated Reasoning checks, domain experts can more easily build specifications called Automated Reasoning Policies that encapsulate their knowledge in fields such as operational workflows and HR policies. Users of Amazon Bedrock Guardrails can validate generated content against an Automated Reasoning Policy to identify inaccuracies and unstated assumptions, and explain why statements are accurate in a verifiable way. For example, you can configure Automated Reasoning checks to validate answers on topics defined in complex HR policies (which can include constraints on employee tenure, location, and performance) and explain why an answer is accurate with supporting evidence.<br> <br> Contact your AWS account team to request access to Automated Reasoning checks in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails in US East (N.

<h4 id="amazon-bedrock-knowledge-bases-now-supports-rag-evaluation-preview">Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases now supports RAG evaluation (Preview)</h4>
<p>Today, we are announcing RAG evaluation support in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. This capability allows you to evaluate your retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications built on Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. You can evaluate either information retrieval or the retrieval plus content generation. Evaluations are powered by LLM-as-a-Judge technology, with customers having a choice of several judge models to use. For retrieval evaluation, you can select from metrics such as context relevance and coverage. For retrieve plus generation evaluation, you can select from quality metrics such as correctness, completeness, and faithfulness (hallucination detection), as well as responsible AI metrics such as harmfulness, answer refusal, and stereotyping. You can also compare across evaluation jobs in order to compare Knowledge Bases with different settings like chunking strategy or vector length, or different content generating models.<br> <br> Evaluating RAG applications can be difficult, as there are many components in the retrieval and generation that need to be optimized. Now, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases’s RAG evaluation tool allows customers to evaluate their Knowledge Base-powered applications conveniently and quickly where their data and LLMs already live. Additionally, you can incorporate Amazon Bedrock Guardrails directly into your evaluation for even more thorough testing. Using these RAG evaluation tools on Amazon Bedrock can save cost as well as weeks of time compared to a full offline human-based evaluation, allowing you to make improvements in your application faster and easier.<br> <br> To learn more, including region availability, read the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-rag-evaluation-and-llm-as-a-judge-capabilities-in-amazon-bedrock" target="_blank">AWS News blog</a> and visit the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/evaluations" target="_blank">Amazon Bedrock Evaluations page</a>.

<h4 id="amazon-cloudfront-now-supports-grpc-delivery">Amazon CloudFront now supports gRPC delivery</h4>
<p>Amazon CloudFront now supports delivery for gRPC applications. <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a> is a modern, open-source remote procedure call (RPC) framework that allows bidirectional communication between a client and a server over HTTP/2 connections. Applications built with gRPC benefit from improved latency using efficient bidirectional streaming and a binary message format, called Protocol Buffers, which are smaller than traditional payloads, like JSON used with RESTful APIs<br> <br> gRPC reduces communication latency for applications which require continuous client-server interactions for a responsive user experience. For example, a ride-sharing application can use gRPC service to automatically update the location of the requested vehicles on the user's device without the user having to request updates each time. gRPC addresses some of the latency challenges associated with using REST APIs for bidirectional communication. With REST APIs, clients establish a connection to the server, make a request, receive a response, and then terminate the connection, which introduces extra latency on each request. With gRPC, the client and server can send multiple messages independently and concurrently using a single connection. Using CloudFront to deliver gRPC applications, customers receive the full advantages of gRPC, plus CloudFront's worldwide reach, speed, and security.<br> <br> CloudFront supports gRPC from all edge locations. This excludes Amazon Web Services China (Beijing) region, operated by Sinnet, and the Amazon Web Services China (Ningxia) region, operated by NWCD. Requests and data transfer fees apply to this feature.

With VPC origins, customers can have their Application Load Balancers (ALB), Network Load Balancers (NLB), and EC2 Instances in a private subnet that is accessible only through their CloudFront distributions. This makes it easy for customers to secure their web applications, allowing them to focus on growing their businesses while improving security and maintaining high-performance and global scalability with CloudFront.<br> <br> AWS customers use CloudFront to deliver highly performant and globally scalable applications. Customers serving content from Amazon S3, AWS Elemental Services and Lambda Function URLs can use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/amazon-cloudfront-introduces-origin-access-control-oac/" target="_blank">Origin Access Control</a> as a managed solution to secure their origins. For origins in VPCs, customers had to keep their origins in public subnets, and use Access Control Lists and other mechanisms to restrict access to their origins. Customers had to spend on-going effort to implement and maintain these solutions, leading to undifferentiated work. VPC origins streamlines security management and reduces operational complexity, making it easy to use CloudFront as the single front door for applications.<br> <br> VPC origins are available in AWS Commercial Regions only, and the full list of supported AWS Regions is available <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-vpc-origins.html#vpc-origins-supported-regions" target="_blank">here</a>.

The warm throughput value provides visibility into the number of read and write operations your DynamoDB tables can readily handle, while pre-warming let’s you proactively increase the value to meet future traffic demands.<br> <br> DynamoDB automatically scales to support workloads of virtually any size. However, when you have peak events like product launches or shopping events, request rates can surge 10x or even 100x in a short period of time. You can now check your tables’ warm throughput value to assess if your table can handle large traffic spikes for peak events. If you expect an upcoming peak event to exceed the current warm throughput value for a given table, you can pre-warm that table in advance of the peak event to ensure it scales instantly to meet demand.<br> <br> Warm throughput values are available for all provisioned and on-demand tables and indexes at no cost. Pre-warming your table's throughput incurs a charge. See <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/on-demand/" target="_blank">Amazon DynamoDB Pricing page</a> for pricing details.

<h4 id="amazon-web-services-announces-declarative-policies">Amazon Web Services announces declarative policies</h4>
<p>Today, AWS announces the general availability of declarative policies, a new management policy type within AWS Organizations. These policies simplify the way customers enforce durable intent, such as baseline configuration for AWS services within their organization. For example, customers can configure EC2 to allow instance launches using AMIs vended by specific providers and block public access in their VPC with a few simple clicks or commands for their entire organization using declarative policies.<br> <br> Declarative policies are designed to prevent actions that are non-compliant with the policy. The configuration defined in the declarative policy is maintained even when services add new APIs or features, or when customers add new principals or accounts to their organization. With declarative policies, governance teams have access to the account status report which provides insight into the current configuration for an AWS service across their organization. This helps them asses readiness to enforce configuration at scale. Administrators can provide additional transparency to end users by configuring custom error messages to redirect them to internal wikis or ticketing systems through declarative policies.<br> <br> To get started, navigate to the AWS Organizations console to create and attach declarative policies. You can also use AWS Control Tower, AWS CLI or CloudFormation templates to configure these policies. Declarative policies today support EC2, EBS and VPC configurations with support for other services coming soon. To learn more see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_declarative.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/simplify-governance-with-declarative-policies" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>

<h4 id="amazon-ec2-introduces-allowed-amis-to-enhance-ami-governance">Amazon EC2 introduces Allowed AMIs to enhance AMI governance</h4>
<p>Amazon EC2 introduces Allowed AMIs, a new account-wide setting that enables you to limit the discovery and use of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) within your AWS accounts. You can now simply specify the AMI owner accounts or AMI owner aliases permitted within your account, and only AMIs from these owners will be visible and available to you to launch EC2 instances.<br> <br> Prior to today, you could use any AMI explicitly shared with your account or any public AMI, regardless of its origin or trustworthiness, putting you at risk of accidentally using an AMI that didn’t meet your organization's compliance requirements. Now with Allowed AMIs, your administrators can specify the accounts or owner aliases whose AMIs are permitted for discovery and use within your AWS environment. This streamlined approach provides guardrails to reduce the risk of inadvertently using non-compliant or unauthorized AMIs. Allowed AMIs also supports an audit-mode functionality to identify EC2 instances launched using AMIs not permitted by this setting, helping you identify non-compliant instances before the setting is applied. You can apply this setting across AWS Organizations and Organizational Units using Declarative Policies, allowing you to manage and enforce this setting at scale.<br> <br> Allowed AMI setting only applies to public AMIs and AMIs explicitly shared with your AWS accounts. By default, this setting is disabled for all AWS accounts. You can enable it by using the AWS CLI, SDKs, or Console.

<p>Starting today, EC2 Auto Scaling and EC2 Fleet customers can express their EC2 instances’ CPU-performance requirements as part of the Attribute-Based Instance Type Selection (ABIS) configuration. With ABIS, customers can already choose a list of instances types by defining a set of desired resource requirements, such as the number of vCPU cores and memory per instance. Now, in addition to the quantitative resource requirements, customers can also identify an instance family that ABIS will use as a baseline to automatically select instance types that offer similar or better CPU performance, enabling customers to further optimize their instance-type selection.<br> <br> ABIS is a powerful tool for customers looking to leverage instance type diversification to meet their capacity requirements. For example, customers who use Spot Instances to launch into limited EC2 spare capacity for a discounted price, access multiple instance types to successfully fulfill their larger capacity needs and experience fewer interruptions. With this release, for example, customers can use ABIS in a launch request for instances that can be in the C, M, and R instance classes, with a minimum of 4 vCPUs, and provide CPU performance in line with the C6i instance family, or better.<br> <br> The feature is available in all AWS commercial and the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

<p>Today, AWS announces support for predictive scaling for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank">Amazon Elastic Container Service</a> (Amazon ECS). Predictive scaling leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to proactively scale your Amazon ECS services ahead of demand surges, reducing overprovisioning costs while improving application responsiveness and availability.<br> <br> Amazon ECS offers a rich set of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-auto-scaling.html" target="_blank">service auto scaling </a>options, including target tracking and step scaling policies, that automatically adjust task counts in response to observed load, as well as scheduled scaling to manually define rules to adjust capacity for routine demand patterns. Many applications observe recurring patterns of steep demand changes, such as early morning spikes when business resumes, wherein a reactive scaling policy can be slow to respond. Predictive scaling is a new capability that harnesses advanced machine learning algorithms, pre-trained on millions of data points, to proactively scale out ECS services ahead of anticipated demand surges. You can use predictive scaling alongside your existing auto scaling policies, such as target tracking or step scaling, so that your applications scale based on both real-time and historic patterns. You can also choose a “forecast only” mode to evaluate its accuracy and suitability, before enabling it to “forecast and scale“. Predictive scaling enhances responsiveness and availability for applications with recurring demand patterns, while also reducing the operational effort of manually configuring scaling policies and the costs from overprovisioning.</p>  <p>You can use AWS management console, SDK, CLI, CloudFormation, and CDK to configure predictive auto scaling for your ECS services.

<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ecs" target="_blank">Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) </a>now allows you to configure software version consistency for specific containers within your Amazon ECS services.<br> <br> By default, Amazon ECS resolves container image tags to the image digest (SHA256 hash of the image manifest) when you create a new Amazon ECS service or deploy an update to the service. This enforces that all tasks in the service are identical and launched with this image digest(s). However, for certain containers within the task (e.g. telemetry sidecars provided by a 3rd party) customers may prefer to not enforce consistency and intead use a mutable container image tag (e.g. LATEST). Now, you can disable software version consistency for one or more containers in your ECS service by configuring the new versionConsistency attribute in the container definition. ECS applies changes to version consistency when you redeploy your ECS service with the task definition revision.<br> <br> You can disable software version consistency for your Amazon ECS services running on AWS Fargate platform version 1.4.0 or higher and/or version v1.70.0 or higher of the Amazon ECS Agent in all commercial and the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

<h4 id="aws-application-load-balancer-introduces-header-modification-for-enhanced-traffic-control-and-security">AWS Application Load Balancer introduces header modification for enhanced traffic control and security</h4>
<p>Application Load Balancer (ALB) now supports HTTP request and response header modification giving you greater controls to manage your application’s traffic and security posture without having to alter your application code.<br> <br> This feature introduces three key capabilities: renaming specific load balancer generated headers, inserting specific response headers, and disabling server response header. With header rename, you can now rename all ALB generated Transport Layer Security (TLS) headers that the load balancer adds to requests, which includes the six mTLS headers and two TLS headers (version and cipher). This capability enables seamless integration with existing applications that expect headers in a specific format, thereby minimizing changes to your backends while using TLS features on the ALB. With header insertion, you can insert custom headers related to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and critical security headers like HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS). Finally, the capability to disable the ALB generated “Server” header in responses reduces exposure of server-specific information, adding an extra layer of protection to your application. These response header modification features give you the ability to centrally enforce your organizations security posture at the load balancer instead of enforcement at individual applications, which can be prone to errors.<br> <br> You can configure Header Modification feature using AWS APIs, AWS CLI, or the AWS Management Console. This feature is available for ALBs in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank">all commercial AWS Regions</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/" target="_blank">AWS GovCloud (US) Regions</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/#AWS_China_Regions*" target="_blank">China Regions</a>.

<p>We are excited to announce Advanced Scaling, a new capability in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/introducing-amazon-emr-managed-scaling-automatically-resize-clusters-to-lower-cost/" target="_blank">Amazon EMR Managed Scaling</a> which provides customers increased flexibility to control the performance and resource utilization of their Amazon EMR on EC2 clusters. With Advanced Scaling, customers will be able to configure the desired resource utilization or performance levels for their cluster, and Amazon EMR Managed Scaling will leverage the customers intent to intelligently scale the cluster and optimize cluster compute resources.<br> <br> Customers appreciate the simplicity of Amazon EMR Managed Scaling. However, there are instances where the default Amazon EMR Managed Scaling algorithm might lead to cluster under-utilization for specific customer’s workload. For instance, clusters running multiple tasks of relatively short duration (task runtime of 10 seconds or less), Amazon EMR Managed Scaling by default scales up the cluster aggressively and conservatively scale it down to avoid negative impact to job run times. While this is the right approach for SLA-sensitive workloads, it might not be optimal for cost sensitive workloads. With Advanced Scaling, customer can now configure Amazon EMR Managed Scaling behavior suitable for their workload type and we will apply tailored optimization to intelligently add or remove nodes from the clusters.<br> <br> To get started with Advanced Scaling, you can set the ScalingStrategy and UtilizationPerformanceIndex parameters either when creating a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/APIReference/API_PutManagedScalingPolicy.html" target="_blank">new</a> Managed Scaling policy, or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/APIReference/API_PutManagedScalingPolicy.html" target="_blank">updating</a> an existing Managed Scaling policy.

<h4 id="aws-announces-aws-security-incident-response-for-general-availability">AWS announces AWS Security Incident Response for general availability</h4>
<p>Today, AWS announces the general availability of AWS Security Incident Response, a new service that helps you prepare for, respond to, and recover from security events. This service offers automated monitoring and investigation of security findings to free up your resources from routine tasks, communication and collaboration features to streamline response coordination, and direct 24/7 access to the AWS Customer Incident Response Team (CIRT).</p>  <p>Security Incident Response integrates with existing detection services, such as Amazon GuardDuty, and third-party tools through AWS Security Hub to rapidly review security alerts, escalate high-priority findings, and, with your permission, implement containment actions. It reduces the number of alerts your team needs to analyze, saving time and allowing your security personnel to focus on strategic initiatives. The service centralizes all incident-related communications, documentation, and actions, making coordinated incident response across internal and external stakeholders possible and reducing the time to coordinate from hours to minutes. You can preconfigure incident response team members, set up automatic notifications, manage case permissions, and use communication tools like video conferencing and in-console messaging during security events. By accessing the service through a single, centralized dashboard in the AWS Management Console, you can monitor active cases, review resolved security incident cases, and track key metrics, such as the number of triaged events and mean time to resolution, in real time. If you require specialized expertise, you can connect 24/7 to the AWS CIRT in only one step.</p>  <p>For more information about AWS Regions where Security Incident Response is available, refer to the following service <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-ir/latest/userguide/supported-configs.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</p>  <p>To get started, visit the <a href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/security-ir" target="_blank">Security Incident Response console</a>, and explore the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security-incident-response/" target="_blank">overview page</a> to learn more.

<h4 id="task-governance-is-now-generally-available-for-amazon-sagemaker-hyperpod">Task governance is now generally available for Amazon SageMaker HyperPod</h4>
<p>Amazon SageMaker HyperPod now provides you with centralized governance across all generative AI development tasks, such as training and inference. You have full visibility and control over compute resource allocation, ensuring the most critical tasks are prioritized and maximizing compute resource utilization, reducing model development costs by up to 40%.<br> <br> With HyperPod task governance, administrators can more easily define priorities for different tasks and set up limits for how many compute resources each team can use. At any given time, administrators can also monitor and audit the tasks that are running or waiting for compute resources through a visual dashboard. When data scientists create their tasks, HyperPod automatically runs them, adhering to the defined compute resource limits and priorities. For example, when training for a high-priority model needs to be completed as soon as possible but all compute resources are in use, HyperPod frees up resources from lower-priority tasks to support the training. HyperPod pauses the low-priority task, saves the checkpoint, and reallocates the freed-up compute resources. The preempted low-priority task will resume from the last saved checkpoint as resources become available again. And when a team is not fully using the resource limits the administrator has set up, HyperPod use those idle resources to accelerate another team’s tasks. Additionally, HyperPod is now integrated with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio/" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Amazon SageMaker Studio</a>, bringing task governance and other HyperPod capabilities into the Studio environment. Data scientists can now seamlessly interact with HyperPod clusters directly from Studio, allowing them to develop, submit, and monitor machine learning (ML) jobs on powerful accelerator-backed clusters.<br> <br> Task governance for HyperPod is available in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">AWS Regions</a> where HyperPod is available: US East (N.

<h4 id="the-amazon-q-index-enhances-software-vendors-ai-experiences">The Amazon Q index enhances software vendors’ AI experiences</h4>
<p>Independent software vendors (ISVs) like Asana, Miro, PagerDuty, Zoom, and more are integrating the Amazon Q index into their applications to enrich their generative AI experiences with enterprise knowledge and user context spanning multiple applications. End customers remain in control of which applications can access their data, and the index retains user-level permissions.</p>  <p>The Amazon Q index is a canonical source of content and data that unites data from across over 40 supported connectors. Amazon Q Business customers create an index based on their enterprise data so that generated responses, insights, and actions are most relevant to employees. Software providers register their application with Amazon Q Business, and then their customers permit them to access their indexed data. Once connected, the software vendor uses the additional data to enrich their native generative AI features to deliver more personalized responses back to the customer. This new feature inherits the same security, privacy, and guardrails as Amazon Q Business, accelerating an ISV’s generative AI roadmap so they can focus their efforts on innovative, differentiated features for their end users. </p>  <p>ISVs can use the Amazon Q index in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">AWS Regions</a> where Amazon Q Business is available. </p>  <p>Learn more about the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/q/software-provider">Amazon Q index for software providers</a>. </p>

<p>Security is the top priority at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>. To that end, Amazon Redshift is introducing enhanced security defaults which helps you adhere to best practices in data security and reduce the risk of potential misconfigurations.<br> <br> Three default security changes will take effect after January 10, 2025. First, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/rs-security-group-public-private.html" target="_blank">public accessibility</a> will be disabled by default for all newly created provisioned clusters and clusters restored from snapshots. By default, connections to clusters will only be permitted from client applications within the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Second, database encryption will be enabled by default for provisioned clusters. When creating a provisioned cluster without specifying a KMS key, the cluster will automatically be encrypted with an AWS-owned key. Third, Amazon Redshift will enforce SSL connections by default for clients connecting to newly created provisioned and restored data warehouses. This default change will also apply to new serverless workgroups.<br> <br> Please review your data warehouse creation configurations, scripts, and tools to make necessary changes to align with new default settings before January 10, 2025, to avoid any potential disruption. You will still have the ability to modify cluster or workgroup settings to change the default behavior.Your existing data warehouses will not be impacted by these security enhancements. However, it is recommended you review and update your configurations to align with the new default security settings in order to further strengthen the security posture.<br> <br> These new default changes will be implemented in all AWS regions where Amazon Redshift is available.

<h4 id="amazon-s3-adds-new-default-data-integrity-protections">Amazon S3 adds new default data integrity protections</h4>
<p>Amazon S3 updates the default behavior of object upload requests with new data integrity protections that build upon S3’s existing durability posture. The latest AWS SDKs now automatically calculate CRC-based checksums for uploads as data is transmitted over the network. S3 independently verifies these checksums and accepts objects after confirming that data integrity was maintained in transit over the public internet. Additionally, S3 now stores a CRC-based whole-object checksum in object metadata, even for multipart uploads, which helps you to verify the integrity of an object stored in S3 at any time.<br> <br> S3 has always validated the integrity of object uploads from the S3 API to storage by calculating MD5 checksums and allowed customers to provide their own pre-calculated MD5 checksums for integrity validation. S3 also supports five additional checksum algorithms, CRC64NVME, CRC32, CRC32C, SHA-1, and SHA-256, for integrity validations on upload and download. Using checksums for data validation is a best practice for data durability, and this new default behavior adds additional data integrity protections with no changes to your applications and at no additional cost.<br> <br> Default checksum protections are rolling out across all AWS Regions in the next few weeks. To get started, you can use the AWS Management Console or the latest AWS SDKs to upload objects.

<p>Amazon S3 now supports enforcement of conditional write operations for S3 general purpose buckets using bucket policies. With enforcement of conditional writes, you can now mandate that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/08/amazon-s3-conditional-writes/" target="_blank">S3 check the existence of an object before creating it</a> in your bucket. Similarly, you can also mandate that S3<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/11/amazon-s3-functionality-conditional-writes" target="_blank"> check the state of the object’s content before updating it</a> in your bucket. This helps you to simplify distributed applications by preventing unintentional data overwrites, especially in high-concurrency, multi-writer scenarios.<br> <br> To enforce conditional write operations, you can now use s3:if-none-match or s3:if-match condition keys to write a bucket policy that mandates the use of HTTP if-none-match or HTTP if-match conditional headers in S3 PutObject and CompleteMultipartUpload API requests. With this bucket policy in place, any attempt to write an object to your bucket without the required conditional header will be rejected. You can use this to centrally enforce the use of conditional writes across all the applications that write to your bucket.<br> <br> You can use bucket policies to enforce conditional writes at no additional charge in all AWS Regions. You can use the AWS SDK, API, or CLI to perform conditional writes.

<h4 id="amazon-s3-adds-new-functionality-for-conditional-writes">Amazon S3 adds new functionality for conditional writes</h4>
<p>Amazon S3 can now perform conditional writes that evaluate if an object is unmodified before updating it. This helps you coordinate simultaneous writes to the same object and prevents multiple concurrent writers from unintentionally overwriting the object without knowing the state of its content. You can use this capability by providing the ETag of an object using S3 PutObject or CompleteMultipartUpload API requests in both S3 general purpose and directory buckets.<br> <br> Conditional writes simplify how distributed applications with multiple clients concurrently update data across shared datasets. Similar to using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/08/amazon-s3-conditional-writes/" target="_blank">HTTP if-none-match conditional header to check for the existence of an object before creating it</a>, clients can now perform conditional-write checks on an object’s Etag, which reflects changes to the object, by specifying it via the HTTP if-match header in the API request. S3 then evaluates if the object's ETag matches the value provided in the API request before committing the write and prevents your clients from overwriting the object until the condition is satisfied. This new conditional header can help improve the efficiency of your large-scale analytics, distributed machine learning, and other highly parallelized workloads by reliably offloading compare and swap operations to S3.<br> <br> This new conditional-write functionality is available at no additional charge in all AWS Regions. You can use the AWS SDK, API, or CLI to perform conditional writes.

Now, in directory buckets, clients can perform conditional delete checks on an object’s last modified time, size, and Etag using the x-amz-if-match-last-modified-time, x-amz-if-match-size, and HTTP if-match headers, respectively, in the DeleteObject and DeleteObjects API. S3 Express One Zone then evaluates if each of these object attributes match the value provided in these headers and prevents your clients from deleting the object until the condition is satisfied. You can use these headers in conjunction or individually in a delete request to reliably offload object-state evaluation to S3 Express One Zone and efficiently secure your distributed and highly parallelized workloads against unintended deletions.<br> <br> S3 Express One Zone support for conditional deletes is available at no additional charge in all AWS Regions where <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-Endpoints.html" target="_blank">the storage class is available</a>.

<p>Amazon S3 Express One Zone now supports the ability to append data to an object. For the first time, applications can add data to an existing object in S3.<br> <br> Applications that continuously receive data over a period of time need the ability to add data to existing objects. For example, log-processing applications continuously add new log entries to the end of existing log files. Similarly, media-broadcasting applications add new video segments to video files as they are transcoded and then immediately stream the video to viewers. Previously, these applications needed to combine data in local storage before copying the final object to S3. Now, applications can directly append new data to existing objects and then immediately read the object, all within S3 Express One Zone.<br> <br> You can append data to objects in S3 Express One Zone in all AWS Regions where the storage class is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-Endpoints.html" target="_blank">available</a>.

<h4 id="amazon-sagemaker-introduces-new-capabilities-to-accelerate-scaling-of-generative-ai-inference">Amazon SageMaker introduces new capabilities to accelerate scaling of Generative AI Inference</h4>
<p>We are excited to announce two new capabilities in SageMaker Inference that significantly enhance the deployment and scaling of generative AI models: Container Caching and Fast Model Loader. These innovations address critical challenges in scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently, enabling faster response times to traffic spikes and more cost-effective scaling. By reducing model loading times and accelerating autoscaling, these features allow customers to improve the responsiveness of their generative AI applications as demand fluctuates, particularly benefiting services with dynamic traffic patterns.<br> <br> Container Caching dramatically reduces the time required to scale generative AI models for inference by pre-caching container images. This eliminates the need to download them when scaling up, resulting in significant reduction in scaling time for generative AI model endpoints. Fast Model Loader streams model weights directly from Amazon S3 to the accelerator, loading models much faster compared to traditional methods. These capabilities allow customers to create more responsive auto-scaling policies, enabling SageMaker to add new instances or model copies quickly when defined thresholds are reached, thus maintaining optimal performance during traffic spikes while at the same time managing costs effectively.<br> <br> These new capabilities are accessible in all AWS regions where Amazon SageMaker Inference is available.

Beyond the need to invest time and effort in due diligence to evaluate existing offerings, customers had to perform undifferentiated heavy lifting in deploying, managing, upgrading and scaling these applications. Furthermore, to adhere to rigorous security and compliance protocols, organizations need their data to stay within the confines of their security boundaries without needing to move their data elsewhere, for example, to a Software as a Service (SaaS) application. Finally, the resulting developer experience is often fragmented, with developers having to switch back and forth between multiple disjointed interfaces. With SageMaker partner AI apps you can quickly subscribe to a partner solution and seamlessly integrate the app with your SageMaker development environment. SageMaker partner AI apps are fully managed and run privately and securely in your SageMaker environment reducing the risk of data and model exfiltration.<br> <br> At launch, you will be able to boost your team’s productivity and reduce time to market by enabling: <a href="https://www.comet.com/site/" target="_blank">Comet</a>, to track, visualize, and manage experiments for AI model development; <a href="https://www.deepchecks.com/" target="_blank">Deepchecks</a>, to evaluate quality and compliance for AI models; <a href="https://www.fiddler.ai/" target="_blank">Fiddler</a>, to validate, monitor, analyze, and improve AI models in production; and, <a href="https://www.lakera.ai/">Lakera</a>, to protect AI applications from security threats such as prompt attacks, data loss and inappropriate content.<br> <br> SageMaker partner AI apps is available in all currently <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/regions-quotas.html" target="_blank">supported regions</a> except Gov Cloud.

<h4 id="task-governance-is-now-generally-available-for-amazon-sagemaker-hyperpod-1">Task governance is now generally available for Amazon SageMaker HyperPod</h4>
<p>Amazon SageMaker HyperPod now provides you with centralized governance across all generative AI development tasks, such as training and inference. You have full visibility and control over compute resource allocation, ensuring the most critical tasks are prioritized and maximizing compute resource utilization, reducing model development costs by up to 40%.<br> <br> With HyperPod task governance, administrators can more easily define priorities for different tasks and set up limits for how many compute resources each team can use. At any given time, administrators can also monitor and audit the tasks that are running or waiting for compute resources through a visual dashboard. When data scientists create their tasks, HyperPod automatically runs them, adhering to the defined compute resource limits and priorities. For example, when training for a high-priority model needs to be completed as soon as possible but all compute resources are in use, HyperPod frees up resources from lower-priority tasks to support the training. HyperPod pauses the low-priority task, saves the checkpoint, and reallocates the freed-up compute resources. The preempted low-priority task will resume from the last saved checkpoint as resources become available again. And when a team is not fully using the resource limits the administrator has set up, HyperPod use those idle resources to accelerate another team’s tasks. Additionally, HyperPod is now integrated with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio/" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Amazon SageMaker Studio</a>, bringing task governance and other HyperPod capabilities into the Studio environment. Data scientists can now seamlessly interact with HyperPod clusters directly from Studio, allowing them to develop, submit, and monitor machine learning (ML) jobs on powerful accelerator-backed clusters.<br> <br> Task governance for HyperPod is available in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">AWS Regions</a> where HyperPod is available: US East (N.

<h4 id="task-governance-is-now-generally-available-for-amazon-sagemaker-hyperpod-2">Task governance is now generally available for Amazon SageMaker HyperPod</h4>
<p>Amazon SageMaker HyperPod now provides you with centralized governance across all generative AI development tasks, such as training and inference. You have full visibility and control over compute resource allocation, ensuring the most critical tasks are prioritized and maximizing compute resource utilization, reducing model development costs by up to 40%.<br> <br> With HyperPod task governance, administrators can more easily define priorities for different tasks and set up limits for how many compute resources each team can use. At any given time, administrators can also monitor and audit the tasks that are running or waiting for compute resources through a visual dashboard. When data scientists create their tasks, HyperPod automatically runs them, adhering to the defined compute resource limits and priorities. For example, when training for a high-priority model needs to be completed as soon as possible but all compute resources are in use, HyperPod frees up resources from lower-priority tasks to support the training. HyperPod pauses the low-priority task, saves the checkpoint, and reallocates the freed-up compute resources. The preempted low-priority task will resume from the last saved checkpoint as resources become available again. And when a team is not fully using the resource limits the administrator has set up, HyperPod use those idle resources to accelerate another team’s tasks. Additionally, HyperPod is now integrated with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio/" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Amazon SageMaker Studio</a>, bringing task governance and other HyperPod capabilities into the Studio environment. Data scientists can now seamlessly interact with HyperPod clusters directly from Studio, allowing them to develop, submit, and monitor machine learning (ML) jobs on powerful accelerator-backed clusters.<br> <br> Task governance for HyperPod is available in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">AWS Regions</a> where HyperPod is available: US East (N.

<h4 id="amazon-verified-permissions-launches-new-api-to-get-multiple-policies">Amazon Verified Permissions launches new API to get multiple policies</h4>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/verified-permissions" target="_blank">Amazon Verified Permissions</a> has launched a new API called batchGetPolicies. Customers can now make a single API call that returns multiple policies, for example to populate a list of policies that apply to a specific principal or resource. Amazon Verified Permissions is a permissions management and fine-grained authorization service for the applications that you build. Amazon Verified Permissions uses the <a href="https://cedarpolicy.com/" target="_blank">Cedar</a> policy language to enable developers and admins to define policy-based access controls based on roles and attributes. For example, a patient management application might call Amazon Verified Permissions (AVP) to determine if Alice is permitted access to Bob’s patient records.<br> <br> The new API accepts up to 100 policy IDs and returns the corresponding set of policies, from across one or more policy stores. This simplifies the integration and reduces latency. Using the API reduces the number of calls that an application needs to make to Verified Permissions. For example, when building a permissions management UX that lists Cedar policies, the application now needs to make only one call to get 50 policies, rather than making 50 calls.<br> <br> This feature is available in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank">all regions</a> where Verified Permissions is available. Pricing is based on the number of policies requested.

<h4 id="aws-announces-block-public-access-for-amazon-virtual-private-cloud">AWS announces Block Public Access for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</h4>
<p>Today, AWS announced Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Block Public Access (BPA), a new centralized declarative control that enables network and security administrators to authoritatively block Internet traffic for their VPCs. VPC BPA supersedes any other setting and ensures your VPC resources are protected from unfettered Internet access in compliance with your organizations security and governance policy.<br> <br> Amazon VPC allows customers to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network. Often times customers have thousands of AWS accounts and VPCs that are owned by multiple business units or application developer teams. Central administrators have the critical responsibility to ensure that resources in their VPCs are accessible to the public Internet in a highly controlled fashion. VPC BPA offers a single declarative control that allows admins to easily block Internet access to VPCs via the Internet Gateway or the Egress-only Internet Gateway and ensures that there is no unintended public exposure to their AWS resources regardless of their routing and security configuration. Admins can apply BPA across all or select VPCs in their account, block bi-directional or ingress-only Internet connectivity and exclude select subnets for resources that need Internet access. VPC BPA is integrated with AWS Network Access Analyzer and VPC Flow Logs to support impact analysis, provide advanced visibility and help customers meet audit and compliance requirements.<br> <br> VPC BPA is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon VPC is offered. There is no additional charge for using this feature.

<h4 id="introducing-advanced-scaling-in-amazon-emr-managed-scaling-1">Introducing Advanced Scaling in Amazon EMR Managed Scaling</h4>
<p>We are excited to announce Advanced Scaling, a new capability in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/introducing-amazon-emr-managed-scaling-automatically-resize-clusters-to-lower-cost/" target="_blank">Amazon EMR Managed Scaling</a> which provides customers increased flexibility to control the performance and resource utilization of their Amazon EMR on EC2 clusters. With Advanced Scaling, customers will be able to configure the desired resource utilization or performance levels for their cluster, and Amazon EMR Managed Scaling will leverage the customers intent to intelligently scale the cluster and optimize cluster compute resources.<br> <br> Customers appreciate the simplicity of Amazon EMR Managed Scaling. However, there are instances where the default Amazon EMR Managed Scaling algorithm might lead to cluster under-utilization for specific customer’s workload. For instance, clusters running multiple tasks of relatively short duration (task runtime of 10 seconds or less), Amazon EMR Managed Scaling by default scales up the cluster aggressively and conservatively scale it down to avoid negative impact to job run times. While this is the right approach for SLA-sensitive workloads, it might not be optimal for cost sensitive workloads. With Advanced Scaling, customer can now configure Amazon EMR Managed Scaling behavior suitable for their workload type and we will apply tailored optimization to intelligently add or remove nodes from the clusters.<br> <br> To get started with Advanced Scaling, you can set the ScalingStrategy and UtilizationPerformanceIndex parameters either when creating a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/APIReference/API_PutManagedScalingPolicy.html" target="_blank">new</a> Managed Scaling policy, or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/APIReference/API_PutManagedScalingPolicy.html" target="_blank">updating</a> an existing Managed Scaling policy. Advanced Scaling is available with Amazon EMR release 7.0 and later and is available in all regions where Amazon EMR Managed Scaling is available. For more details, please refer to our <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/managed-scaling-allocation-strategy-optimized.html" target="_blank">Advanced Scaling documentation</a>.</p>

<h4 id="amazon-opensearch-service-now-scales-to-1000-data-nodes-on-a-single-cluster-1">Amazon OpenSearch Service now scales to 1000 data nodes on a single cluster</h4>
<p>Amazon OpenSearch Service now enables you to scale a single cluster to 1000 data nodes (1000 hot nodes and/or 750 warm nodes) and enables you to manage 25 petabytes of data (10 Petabytes in hot nodes and further 15 Petabytes in warm nodes). You no longer need to setup multiple clusters for workloads that require more than 200 data nodes or more than 3 Petabytes of data.<br> <br> Today, for workloads of more than 3 to 4 petabytes of data, you need to create multiple clusters in OpenSearch Service. This may have required you to refactor your applications or business logic to work with your workload split across multiple clusters. In addition, every cluster requires its own configuration, management, and monitoring, adding to the operational overhead. With this launch, you can scale a single cluster up to 1000 nodes, or 25 petabytes of data, removing the operational overhead that comes with managing multiple clusters.<br> <br> To scale a cluster beyond 200 nodes, you have to request an increase through Service Quota, after which you can modify your cluster configuration using the AWS Console, AWS CLI, or the AWS SDK. Depending on the size of the cluster, OpenSearch Service will recommend configuration pre-requisites across data nodes, cluster manager nodes, and coordinator nodes. For more information, refer to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/limits.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.<br> <br> The new limits are available to all OpenSearch Service clusters running OpenSearch 2.17 and above in all AWS regions where Amazon OpenSearch Service is available.

<h4 id="amazon-redshift-to-enhance-security-by-changing-default-behavior-1">Amazon Redshift to enhance security by changing default behavior</h4>
<p>Security is the top priority at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>. To that end, Amazon Redshift is introducing enhanced security defaults which helps you adhere to best practices in data security and reduce the risk of potential misconfigurations.<br> <br> Three default security changes will take effect after January 10, 2025. First, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/rs-security-group-public-private.html" target="_blank">public accessibility</a> will be disabled by default for all newly created provisioned clusters and clusters restored from snapshots. By default, connections to clusters will only be permitted from client applications within the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Second, database encryption will be enabled by default for provisioned clusters. When creating a provisioned cluster without specifying a KMS key, the cluster will automatically be encrypted with an AWS-owned key. Third, Amazon Redshift will enforce SSL connections by default for clients connecting to newly created provisioned and restored data warehouses. This default change will also apply to new serverless workgroups.<br> <br> Please review your data warehouse creation configurations, scripts, and tools to make necessary changes to align with new default settings before January 10, 2025, to avoid any potential disruption. You will still have the ability to modify cluster or workgroup settings to change the default behavior.Your existing data warehouses will not be impacted by these security enhancements. However, it is recommended you review and update your configurations to align with the new default security settings in order to further strengthen the security posture.<br> <br> These new default changes will be implemented in all AWS regions where Amazon Redshift is available.

<h4 id="introducing-amazon-q-apps-with-private-sharing-1">Introducing Amazon Q Apps with private sharing</h4>
<p>Amazon Q Apps, a capability within Amazon Q Business to create lightweight, generative AI-powered apps, now supports private sharing. This new feature enables app creators to restrict app access to select Amazon Q Business users, providing more granular control over app visibility and usage within organizations.<br> <br> Previously, Amazon Q Apps could only be kept private for individual use or published to all users of the Amazon Q Business environment through the Amazon Q Apps library. Now app creators can share their apps with specific individuals allowing for more targeted collaboration and controlled access. App users with access to shared apps can find these apps in the Amazon Q Apps Library and run them. Apps shown in the library respect the access set by the app creator so those are visible only to selected users. Private sharing enables new functional use cases. For instance, a messaging-compliant document generation app may be shared company-wide for anyone in the organization to use, while a customer outreach app could be restricted to individuals of the sales team only. Private sharing also opens up possibilities for app creators to gather early feedback from a small group of users before wider distribution of their app.<br> <br> Amazon Q Apps with private sharing is now available in the same regions where Amazon Q Business is available.<br> <br> To learn more about private sharing in Amazon Q Apps, visit the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/qapps-private-sharing.html" target="_blank">Q Apps documentation</a>.</p>

<h4 id="aws-lambda-announces-provisioned-mode-for-kafka-event-source-mappings-esms">AWS Lambda announces Provisioned Mode for Kafka event source mappings (ESMs)</h4>
<p>AWS Lambda announces Provisioned Mode for event source mappings (ESMs) that subscribe to Apache Kafka event sources, a feature that allows you to optimize the throughput of your Kafka ESM by provisioning event polling resources that remain ready to handle sudden spikes in traffic. Provisioned Mode helps you build highly responsive and scalable event-driven Kafka applications with stringent performance requirements.<br> <br> Customers building streaming data applications often use Kafka as an event source for Lambda functions, and use Lambda's fully-managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-msk.html" target="_blank">MSK ESM</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-kafka.html" target="_blank">self-managed Kafka ESM</a>, which automatically scale polling resources in response to events. However, for event-driven Kafka applications that need to handle unpredictable bursts of traffic, lack of control over the throughput of ESM can lead to delays in your users’ experience. Provisioned Mode for Kafka ESM allows you to fine-tune the throughput of the ESM by provisioning and auto-scaling between a minimum and maximum number of polling resources called event pollers, and is ideal for real-time applications with stringent performance requirements.<br> <br> This feature is generally available in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank">AWS Commercial Regions</a> where AWS Lambda is available, except Israel (Tel Aviv), Asia Pacific (Malaysia), and Canada West (Calgary).<br> <br> You can activate Provisioned Mode for MSK ESM or self-managed Kafka ESM by configuring a minimum and maximum number of event pollers in the ESM API, AWS Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDK, AWS CloudFormation, and AWS SAM. You pay for the usage of event pollers, along a billing unit called Event Poller Unit (EPU).

<h4 id="cross-zone-enabled-application-load-balancer-now-supports-zonal-shift-and-zonal-autoshift-1">Cross-zone enabled Application Load Balancer now supports zonal shift and zonal autoshift</h4>
<p>AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) now supports Amazon Application Recovery Controller’s zonal shift and zonal autoshift features on load balancers that are enabled across zones. Zonal shift allows you to quickly shift traffic away from an impaired Availability Zone (AZ) and recover from events such as bad application deployment and gray failures. Zonal autoshift safely and automatically shifts your traffic away from an AZ when AWS identifies potential impact to it.<br> <br> Enabling cross-zone on ALBs is a popular configuration for customers that require an even distribution of traffic across application targets in multiple AZs. With this launch, customers can shift traffic away from an AZ in the event of a failure just like they are able to for cross-zone disabled load balancers. When zonal shift or autoshift is triggered, the ALB will block all traffic to targets in the AZ that is impacted and remove the zonal IP from DNS. You can configure this feature in two steps: First, enable configuration to allow zonal shift to act on your load balancer(s) using the ALB console or API. Second, trigger zonal shift or enable zonal autoshift for the chosen ALBs via Amazon Application Recovery Controller console or API.<br> <br> Zonal shift and zonal autoshift support on ALB is available in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank">all commercial AWS Regions</a>, including the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/" target="_blank">AWS GovCloud (US) Regions</a>.

<h4 id="aws-step-functions-simplifies-developer-experience-with-variables-and-jsonata-transformations">AWS Step Functions simplifies developer experience with Variables and JSONata transformations</h4>
<p>AWS Step Functions announces support for two new capabilities: Variables and JSONata data transformations. Variables allow developers to assign data in one state and reference it in a subsequent state, simplifying state payload management, reducing the need to pass data through multiple intermediate states. With support for JSONata, an open source query and transformation language, customers can now perform advanced data manipulation and transformation such as date and time formatting, and mathematical operations. Additionally, when using JSONata, we have simplified input and output processing by reducing the number of JSON transformation fields required to call services and pass data to the next state.<br> <br> AWS Step Functions is a visual workflow service capable of orchestrating over 14,000 API actions from over 220 AWS services to build distributed applications and data processing workloads. With support for Variables and JSONata, developers can build distributed serverless applications faster and more efficiently with enhanced payload management capabilities.

<h4 id="announcing-new-amazon-cloudwatch-metrics-for-aws-lambda-event-source-mappings-esms">Announcing new Amazon CloudWatch Metrics for AWS Lambda Event Source Mappings (ESMs)</h4>
<p>AWS Lambda announces new Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Lambda Event Source Mappings (ESMs), which provide customers visibility into the processing state of events read by ESMs that subscribe to Amazon SQS, Amazon Kinesis, and Amazon DynamoDB event sources. This enables customers to easily monitor issues or delays in event processing and take corrective actions.<br> <br> Customers use ESMs to read events from event sources and invoke Lambda functions. Lack of visibility into processing state of events ingested by ESMs delays diagnosis of event processing issues. Customers can now use the following CloudWatch metrics to monitor the processing state of events ingested by ESMs — PolledEventCount, InvokedEventCount, FilteredOutEventCount, FailedInvokeEventCount, DeletedEventCount, DroppedEventCount, and OnFailureDestinationDeliveredEventCount. <em>PolledEventCount</em> counts the events read by an ESM, and <em>InvokedEventCount</em> counts the events that invoked a Lambda function.<em> FilteredOutEventCount</em> counts the events filtered out by an ESM. <em>FailedInvokeEventCount </em>counts the events that attempted to invoke a Lambda function, but encountered failure. <em>DeletedEventCount</em> counts the events that have been deleted from the SQS queue by Lambda upon successful processing. <em>DroppedEventCount </em>counts the events dropped due to event expiry or exhaustion of retry attempts. <em>OnFailureDestinationDeliveredEventCount</em> counts the events successfully sent to an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/kinesis-on-failure-destination.html" target="_blank">on-failure destination</a>.<br> <br> This feature is generally available in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank">AWS Commercial Regions</a> where AWS Lambda is available.<br> <br> You can enable ESM metrics using Lambda event source mapping API, AWS Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDK, AWS CloudFormation, and AWS SAM.

<p>Amazon SQS increases the in-flight limit for FIFO queues from 20K to 120K messages. When a message is sent to an SQS FIFO queue, it is added to the queue backlog. Once you invoke a receive request on the FIFO queue, the message is now marked as in-flight and remains in-flight until a delete message request is invoked.<br> <br> With this change to the in-flight limit, your receivers can now process a maximum of 120K messages concurrently, increased from 20K previously, via SQS FIFO queues. If you have sufficient publish throughput and were constrained by the 20K in-flight limit, you can now process up to 120K messages at a time by scaling your receivers.<br> <br> The increased in-flight limits is available in all commercial and the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions where SQS FIFO queues are available.<br> <br> To get started, see the following resources:</p>  <ul> 	<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/high-throughput-fifo.html" target="_blank">High-Throughput SQS FIFO queues</a>, in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide</li> 	<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/quotas-fifo.html" target="_blank">SQS FIFO queue quotas</a>, in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide</li> </ul>

<h4 id="amazon-sagemaker-introduces-new-capabilities-to-accelerate-scaling-of-generative-ai-inference-1">Amazon SageMaker introduces new capabilities to accelerate scaling of Generative AI Inference</h4>
<p>We are excited to announce two new capabilities in SageMaker Inference that significantly enhance the deployment and scaling of generative AI models: Container Caching and Fast Model Loader. These innovations address critical challenges in scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently, enabling faster response times to traffic spikes and more cost-effective scaling. By reducing model loading times and accelerating autoscaling, these features allow customers to improve the responsiveness of their generative AI applications as demand fluctuates, particularly benefiting services with dynamic traffic patterns.<br> <br> Container Caching dramatically reduces the time required to scale generative AI models for inference by pre-caching container images. This eliminates the need to download them when scaling up, resulting in significant reduction in scaling time for generative AI model endpoints. Fast Model Loader streams model weights directly from Amazon S3 to the accelerator, loading models much faster compared to traditional methods. These capabilities allow customers to create more responsive auto-scaling policies, enabling SageMaker to add new instances or model copies quickly when defined thresholds are reached, thus maintaining optimal performance during traffic spikes while at the same time managing costs effectively.<br> <br> These new capabilities are accessible in all AWS regions where Amazon SageMaker Inference is available.

<p>Today Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) announced the general availability of Amazon SageMaker partner AI apps, a new capability that enables customers to easily discover, deploy, and use best-in-class machine learning (ML) and generative AI (GenAI) development applications from leading app providers privately and securely, all without leaving Amazon SageMaker AI so they can develop performant AI models faster.<br> <br> Until today, integrating purpose-built GenAI and ML development applications that provide specialized capabilities for a variety of model development tasks, required a considerable amount of effort. Beyond the need to invest time and effort in due diligence to evaluate existing offerings, customers had to perform undifferentiated heavy lifting in deploying, managing, upgrading and scaling these applications. Furthermore, to adhere to rigorous security and compliance protocols, organizations need their data to stay within the confines of their security boundaries without needing to move their data elsewhere, for example, to a Software as a Service (SaaS) application. Finally, the resulting developer experience is often fragmented, with developers having to switch back and forth between multiple disjointed interfaces. With SageMaker partner AI apps you can quickly subscribe to a partner solution and seamlessly integrate the app with your SageMaker development environment. SageMaker partner AI apps are fully managed and run privately and securely in your SageMaker environment reducing the risk of data and model exfiltration.<br> <br> At launch, you will be able to boost your team’s productivity and reduce time to market by enabling: <a href="https://www.comet.com/site/" target="_blank">Comet</a>, to track, visualize, and manage experiments for AI model development; <a href="https://www.deepchecks.com/" target="_blank">Deepchecks</a>, to evaluate quality and compliance for AI models; <a href="https://www.fiddler.ai/" target="_blank">Fiddler</a>, to validate, monitor, analyze, and improve AI models in production; and, <a href="https://www.lakera.ai/">Lakera</a>, to protect AI applications from security threats such as prompt attacks, data loss and inappropriate content.<br> <br> SageMaker partner AI apps is available in all currently <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/regions-quotas.html" target="_blank">supported regions</a> except Gov Cloud.

<h4 id="task-governance-is-now-generally-available-for-amazon-sagemaker-hyperpod-3">Task governance is now generally available for Amazon SageMaker HyperPod</h4>
<p>Amazon SageMaker HyperPod now provides you with centralized governance across all generative AI development tasks, such as training and inference. You have full visibility and control over compute resource allocation, ensuring the most critical tasks are prioritized and maximizing compute resource utilization, reducing model development costs by up to 40%.<br> <br> With HyperPod task governance, administrators can more easily define priorities for different tasks and set up limits for how many compute resources each team can use. At any given time, administrators can also monitor and audit the tasks that are running or waiting for compute resources through a visual dashboard. When data scientists create their tasks, HyperPod automatically runs them, adhering to the defined compute resource limits and priorities. For example, when training for a high-priority model needs to be completed as soon as possible but all compute resources are in use, HyperPod frees up resources from lower-priority tasks to support the training. HyperPod pauses the low-priority task, saves the checkpoint, and reallocates the freed-up compute resources. The preempted low-priority task will resume from the last saved checkpoint as resources become available again. And when a team is not fully using the resource limits the administrator has set up, HyperPod use those idle resources to accelerate another team’s tasks. Additionally, HyperPod is now integrated with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio/" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Amazon SageMaker Studio</a>, bringing task governance and other HyperPod capabilities into the Studio environment.

<h4 id="amazon-bedrock-guardrails-now-supports-automated-reasoning-checks-preview-1">Amazon Bedrock Guardrails now supports Automated Reasoning checks (Preview)</h4>
<p>With the launch of the Automated Reasoning checks safeguard in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, AWS becomes the first and only major cloud provider to integrate automated reasoning in our generative AI offerings. Automated Reasoning checks help detect hallucinations and provide a verifiable proof that a large language model (LLM) response is accurate. Automated Reasoning tools are not guessing or predicting accuracy. Instead, they rely on sound mathematical techniques to definitively verify compliance with expert-created Automated Reasoning Policies, consequently improving transparency. Organizations increasingly use LLMs to improve user experiences and reduce operational costs by enabling conversational access to relevant, contextualized information. However, LLMs are prone to hallucinations. Due to the ability of LLMs to generate compelling answers, these hallucinations are often difficult to detect. The possibility of hallucinations and an inability to explain why they occurred slows generative AI adoption for use cases where accuracy is critical.<br> <br> With Automated Reasoning checks, domain experts can more easily build specifications called Automated Reasoning Policies that encapsulate their knowledge in fields such as operational workflows and HR policies. Users of Amazon Bedrock Guardrails can validate generated content against an Automated Reasoning Policy to identify inaccuracies and unstated assumptions, and explain why statements are accurate in a verifiable way. For example, you can configure Automated Reasoning checks to validate answers on topics defined in complex HR policies (which can include constraints on employee tenure, location, and performance) and explain why an answer is accurate with supporting evidence.<br> <br> Contact your AWS account team to request access to Automated Reasoning checks in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails in US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon) <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glossary/latest/reference/glos-chap.html#region" target="_blank">AWS regions</a>.

<h4 id="aws-appsync-now-supports-cross-account-sharing-of-graphql-apis">AWS AppSync now supports cross account sharing of GraphQL APIs</h4>
<p>AWS AppSync is a fully managed API management service that connects applications to events, data, and AI models. AppSync now supports sharing GraphQL APIs across AWS accounts using AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM). This new feature allows customers to securely share their AppSync GraphQL APIs configured with IAM authorization, including private APIs, with other AWS accounts within their organization or with third parties.<br> <br> Before today, customers had to set up additional networking infrastructure to share their private GraphQL APIs between their organization accounts. With this enhancement, customers can now centralize their GraphQL API management in a dedicated account and share access to these APIs with other accounts. For example, a central API team can create and manage private GraphQL APIs, then share them with different application or networking teams in different accounts. This approach simplifies API governance, improves security, and enables more flexible and scalable architectures for multi-account environments. Customers can optionally enable CloudTrail to capture API activities related to AWS AppSync GraphQL APIs as events for additional security and visibility.<br> <br> This feature is now available in all AWS Regions where AWS AppSync is available.<br> <br> To get started, refer to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/sharing-graphql-apis.html" target="_blank">AWS AppSync GraphQL documentation</a>, and visit the AWS RAM console to start sharing your APIs.

<p>AWS AppSync, a fully managed API management service that connects applications to events, data, and AI models. Today, customers use AppSync as an AI gateway to trigger generative AI workflows and use subscriptions, powered by WebSockets, to return progressive updates from long-running invocations. This allows them to implement asynchronous patterns. However, in some cases, customers need to make short synchronous invocations to their models. AWS AppSync now supports Amazon Bedrock runtime as a data source for GraphQL APIs, enabling seamless integration of generative AI capabilities. This new feature allows developers to make short synchronous invocations (10 seconds or less) to foundation models and inference profiles in Amazon Bedrock directly from their AppSync GraphQL APIs.<br> <br> The integration supports calling the converse and invokeModel APIs. Developers can interact with Anthropic models like Claude 3.5 Haiku and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for data analysis and structured object generation tasks. They can also use Amazon Titan models to generate embeddings, create summaries, or extract action items from meeting minutes.<br> <br> For longer-running invocations, customers can continue using AWS Lambda functions in event mode to interact with Bedrock models and send progressive updates to clients via subscriptions.<br> <br> This new data source is available in all AWS Regions where AWS AppSync is available. To get started, customers can visit the AWS AppSync console and refer to the AWS AppSync <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/resolver-reference-bedrock-js.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> for more information.<br>  </p>

<h4 id="aws-cloud-wan-simplifies-on-premises-connectivity-via-aws-direct-connect">AWS Cloud WAN simplifies on-premises connectivity via AWS Direct Connect</h4>
<p>AWS Cloud WAN now supports native integration with AWS Direct Connect, simplifying connectivity between your on-premises networks and the AWS cloud. The new capability enables you to directly attach your Direct Connect gateways to Cloud WAN without the need for an intermediate AWS Transit Gateway, allowing seamless connectivity between your data centers or offices with AWS Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) across AWS regions globally.<br> <br> Cloud WAN allows you to build, monitor, and manage a unified global network that interconnects your resources in the AWS cloud and your on-premises environments. Direct Connect allows you to create a dedicated network connection to AWS, bypassing the public Internet. Until today, customers needed to deploy an intermediate transit gateway to interconnect their Direct Connect-based networks with Cloud WAN. Starting today, you can directly attach your Direct Connect gateway to a Cloud WAN core network simplifying connectivity between your on-premises locations and VPCs. The new Cloud WAN Direct Connect attachment adds support for automatic route propagation between AWS and on-premises networks using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Direct Connect attachments also supports existing Cloud WAN features such as central policy-based management, tag-based attachment automation and segmentation for advanced security.<br> <br> The new Direct Connect attachment for Cloud WAN is initially available in eleven commercial regions. Pricing for Direct Connect attachment is the same as any other Cloud WAN attachment.

<p>AWS Transit Gateway (TGW) and AWS Cloud WAN now support per availability zone (AZ) metrics delivered to CloudWatch. Furthermore, both services now support Path Maximum Transmission Unit Discovery (PMTUD) for effective mitigation against MTU mismatch issues in their global networks.<br> <br> TGW and Cloud WAN allow customers to monitor their global network through performance and traffic metrics such as bytes in/out, packets in/out, and packets dropped. Until now, these metrics were available at an attachment level, and aggregate TGW and Core Network Edge (CNE) levels. With this launch, customers have more granular visibility into AZ-level metrics for VPC attachments. AZ-level metrics enable customers to rapidly troubleshoot any AZ impairments and provide deeper visibility in AZ-level traffic patterns across TGW and Cloud WAN.<br> <br> TGW and Cloud WAN now also support standard PMTUD mechanism for traffic ingressing on VPC attachments. Until now, jumbo sized packets exceeding the TGW/CNE MTU (8500 bytes) would get silently dropped on VPC attachments. With this launch, an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) <em>Fragmentation Needed</em> response message is sent back to sender hosts allowing them to remediate packet MTU size and thus minimize packet loss due to MTU mismatches in their network. PMTUD support is available for both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.<br> <br> The per-AZ CloudWatch metrics and PMTUD support are available within each service in all AWS Regions where TGW or Cloud WAN are available.

<h4 id="get-x-ray-vision-into-aws-cloudformation-deployments-with-a-timeline-view">Get x-ray vision into AWS CloudFormation deployments with a timeline view</h4>
<p>AWS CloudFormation now offers a capability called deployment timeline view that allows customers to monitor and visualize the sequence of actions CloudFormation takes in a stack operation. This capability provides visibility into the ordering and duration of resource provisioning actions for a stack operation. This empowers developers to optimize their CloudFormation templates and speed up troubleshooting of deployment issues.<br> <br> When you create, update, or delete a stack, CloudFormation initiates resource-level provisioning actions based on a resource dependency graph. For example, if you submit a CloudFormation template with an EC2 instance, Security Group, and VPC, CloudFormation creates the VPC, Security Group, and EC2 instance in that order. Previously, you could only see the chronological list of stack operation events, which provided limited visibility into dependencies between resources and the ordering of provisioning actions. Now, you can see a graphical visualization that shows the order in which CloudFormation provisions resources within a stack, color-coding the status of each resource, and the duration of each provisioning action. If a resource provisioning encounters an error, it highlights the likely root cause. This allows you to determine the optimal grouping of resources into templates, for minimizing deployment times and improving maintainability.<br> <br> The new capability is available in all AWS Regions where CloudFormation is supported. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/cfn.html#cfn_region" target="_blank">AWS Region table</a> for service availability details.<br> <br> Get started by initiating a stack operation and accessing the deployment timeline view from the stack events tab in the CloudFormation Console.

<h4 id="aws-cloudtrail-lake-announces-enhanced-event-filtering">AWS CloudTrail Lake announces enhanced event filtering</h4>
<p>AWS enhances event filtering in AWS CloudTrail Lake, a managed data lake that helps you capture, immutably store, access, and analyze your activity logs, as well as AWS Config configuration items. Enhanced event filtering expands upon existing filtering capabilities, giving you even greater control over which CloudTrail events are ingested into your event data stores. This enhancement increases the efficiency and precision of your security, compliance, and operational investigations while helping reduce costs.<br> <br> You can now filter both management and data events by the following new attributes:</p>  <ul> 	<li><u>eventSource:</u> The service that the request was made to</li> 	<li><u>eventType:</u> Type of event that generated the event record (e.g., AwsApiCall, AwsServiceEvent, etc)</li> 	<li><u>userIdentity.arn:</u> IAM entity that made the request</li> 	<li><u>sessionCredentialFromConsole:</u> Whether the event originated from an AWS Management Console session or not</li> </ul>  <p>For management events, you can additionally filter by eventName which identifies the requested API action.<br> <br> For each of these attributes, you can specify values to include or exclude. For example, you can now filter CloudTrail events based on the userIdentity.arn attribute to exclude events generated by specific IAM roles or users. You can exclude a dedicated IAM role used by a service that performs frequent API calls for monitoring purposes. This allows you to significantly reduce the volume of CloudTrail events ingested into CloudTrail Lake, lowering costs while maintaining visibility into relevant user and system activities.<br> <br> Enhanced event filtering is available in all AWS Regions where AWS CloudTrail Lake is supported, at no additional charge.

<h4 id="amazon-web-services-announces-declarative-policies-1">Amazon Web Services announces declarative policies</h4>
<p>Today, AWS announces the general availability of declarative policies, a new management policy type within AWS Organizations. These policies simplify the way customers enforce durable intent, such as baseline configuration for AWS services within their organization. For example, customers can configure EC2 to allow instance launches using AMIs vended by specific providers and block public access in their VPC with a few simple clicks or commands for their entire organization using declarative policies.<br> <br> Declarative policies are designed to prevent actions that are non-compliant with the policy. The configuration defined in the declarative policy is maintained even when services add new APIs or features, or when customers add new principals or accounts to their organization. With declarative policies, governance teams have access to the account status report which provides insight into the current configuration for an AWS service across their organization. This helps them asses readiness to enforce configuration at scale. Administrators can provide additional transparency to end users by configuring custom error messages to redirect them to internal wikis or ticketing systems through declarative policies.<br> <br> To get started, navigate to the AWS Organizations console to create and attach declarative policies. You can also use AWS Control Tower, AWS CLI or CloudFormation templates to configure these policies. Declarative policies today support EC2, EBS and VPC configurations with support for other services coming soon. To learn more see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_declarative.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/simplify-governance-with-declarative-policies" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>

<h4 id="amazon-web-services-announces-declarative-policies-2">Amazon Web Services announces declarative policies</h4>
<p>Today, AWS announces the general availability of declarative policies, a new management policy type within AWS Organizations. These policies simplify the way customers enforce durable intent, such as baseline configuration for AWS services within their organization. For example, customers can configure EC2 to allow instance launches using AMIs vended by specific providers and block public access in their VPC with a few simple clicks or commands for their entire organization using declarative policies.<br> <br> Declarative policies are designed to prevent actions that are non-compliant with the policy. The configuration defined in the declarative policy is maintained even when services add new APIs or features, or when customers add new principals or accounts to their organization. With declarative policies, governance teams have access to the account status report which provides insight into the current configuration for an AWS service across their organization. This helps them asses readiness to enforce configuration at scale. Administrators can provide additional transparency to end users by configuring custom error messages to redirect them to internal wikis or ticketing systems through declarative policies.<br> <br> To get started, navigate to the AWS Organizations console to create and attach declarative policies. You can also use AWS Control Tower, AWS CLI or CloudFormation templates to configure these policies. Declarative policies today support EC2, EBS and VPC configurations with support for other services coming soon. To learn more see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_declarative.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/simplify-governance-with-declarative-policies" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Amazon S3 updates the default behavior of object upload requests with new data integrity protections that build upon S3’s existing durability posture. The latest AWS SDKs now automatically calculate CRC-based checksums for uploads as data is transmitted over the network. S3 independently verifies these checksums and accepts objects after confirming that data integrity was maintained in transit over the public internet. Additionally, S3 now stores a CRC-based whole-object checksum in object metadata, even for multipart uploads, which helps you to verify the integrity of an object stored in S3 at any time.<br> <br> S3 has always validated the integrity of object uploads from the S3 API to storage by calculating MD5 checksums and allowed customers to provide their own pre-calculated MD5 checksums for integrity validation. S3 also supports five additional checksum algorithms, CRC64NVME, CRC32, CRC32C, SHA-1, and SHA-256, for integrity validations on upload and download. Using checksums for data validation is a best practice for data durability, and this new default behavior adds additional data integrity protections with no changes to your applications and at no additional cost.<br> <br> Default checksum protections are rolling out across all AWS Regions in the next few weeks. To get started, you can use the AWS Management Console or the latest AWS SDKs to upload objects.

Today, we are launching automatically-generated query filters which improves retrieval accuracy by ensuring the documents retrieved are relevant to the query. This feature extends the existing capability of manual metadata filtering, by allowing customers to narrow down search results without the need to manually construct complex filter expressions.<br> <br> RAG applications process user queries by searching across a large set of documents. However, in many situations you may need to retrieve documents with specific attributes and/or content. With automatic generated query filters enabled, you can receive filtered search results which are based on the document’s metadata without the need to manually construct complex filter expressions. For example, for a query like "How to file a claim in Washington", the state as "Washington" will be automatically applied as a filter to retrieve only those documents pertaining to the particular state.<br> <br> The capability is available in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Zurich) and AWS GovCloud (US-West).

<h4 id="amazon-ec2-introduces-allowed-amis-to-enhance-ami-governance-1">Amazon EC2 introduces Allowed AMIs to enhance AMI governance</h4>
<p>Amazon EC2 introduces Allowed AMIs, a new account-wide setting that enables you to limit the discovery and use of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) within your AWS accounts. You can now simply specify the AMI owner accounts or AMI owner aliases permitted within your account, and only AMIs from these owners will be visible and available to you to launch EC2 instances.<br> <br> Prior to today, you could use any AMI explicitly shared with your account or any public AMI, regardless of its origin or trustworthiness, putting you at risk of accidentally using an AMI that didn’t meet your organization's compliance requirements. Now with Allowed AMIs, your administrators can specify the accounts or owner aliases whose AMIs are permitted for discovery and use within your AWS environment. This streamlined approach provides guardrails to reduce the risk of inadvertently using non-compliant or unauthorized AMIs. Allowed AMIs also supports an audit-mode functionality to identify EC2 instances launched using AMIs not permitted by this setting, helping you identify non-compliant instances before the setting is applied. You can apply this setting across AWS Organizations and Organizational Units using Declarative Policies, allowing you to manage and enforce this setting at scale.<br> <br> Allowed AMI setting only applies to public AMIs and AMIs explicitly shared with your AWS accounts. By default, this setting is disabled for all AWS accounts. You can enable it by using the AWS CLI, SDKs, or Console.

<h4 id="amazon-s3-now-supports-enforcement-of-conditional-write-operations-for-s3-general-purpose-buckets-1">Amazon S3 now supports enforcement of conditional write operations for S3 general purpose buckets</h4>
<p>Amazon S3 now supports enforcement of conditional write operations for S3 general purpose buckets using bucket policies. With enforcement of conditional writes, you can now mandate that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/08/amazon-s3-conditional-writes/" target="_blank">S3 check the existence of an object before creating it</a> in your bucket. Similarly, you can also mandate that S3<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/11/amazon-s3-functionality-conditional-writes" target="_blank"> check the state of the object’s content before updating it</a> in your bucket. This helps you to simplify distributed applications by preventing unintentional data overwrites, especially in high-concurrency, multi-writer scenarios.<br> <br> To enforce conditional write operations, you can now use s3:if-none-match or s3:if-match condition keys to write a bucket policy that mandates the use of HTTP if-none-match or HTTP if-match conditional headers in S3 PutObject and CompleteMultipartUpload API requests. With this bucket policy in place, any attempt to write an object to your bucket without the required conditional header will be rejected. You can use this to centrally enforce the use of conditional writes across all the applications that write to your bucket.<br> <br> You can use bucket policies to enforce conditional writes at no additional charge in all AWS Regions. You can use the AWS SDK, API, or CLI to perform conditional writes.

<h4 id="amazon-s3-adds-new-functionality-for-conditional-writes-1">Amazon S3 adds new functionality for conditional writes</h4>
<p>Amazon S3 can now perform conditional writes that evaluate if an object is unmodified before updating it. This helps you coordinate simultaneous writes to the same object and prevents multiple concurrent writers from unintentionally overwriting the object without knowing the state of its content. You can use this capability by providing the ETag of an object using S3 PutObject or CompleteMultipartUpload API requests in both S3 general purpose and directory buckets.<br> <br> Conditional writes simplify how distributed applications with multiple clients concurrently update data across shared datasets. Similar to using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/08/amazon-s3-conditional-writes/" target="_blank">HTTP if-none-match conditional header to check for the existence of an object before creating it</a>, clients can now perform conditional-write checks on an object’s Etag, which reflects changes to the object, by specifying it via the HTTP if-match header in the API request. S3 then evaluates if the object's ETag matches the value provided in the API request before committing the write and prevents your clients from overwriting the object until the condition is satisfied. This new conditional header can help improve the efficiency of your large-scale analytics, distributed machine learning, and other highly parallelized workloads by reliably offloading compare and swap operations to S3.<br> <br> This new conditional-write functionality is available at no additional charge in all AWS Regions. You can use the AWS SDK, API, or CLI to perform conditional writes.

This monitoring gives more confidence and additional safety controls when making any change on production.<br> <br> Unexpected downtime or degraded performance can occur from faulty changes to feature flags or configuration data. AWS AppConfig provides safety guardrails to reduce this risk. One key safety guardrail for AWS AppConfig is the ability to have AWS AppConfig immediately roll back a change when a monitor alerts during the rollout of a feature flag or configuration change. This automation can typically remediate problems faster than a human operator can. Customers can use AWS AppConfig Extensions to connect to any API-enabled APM, including proprietary solutions.<br> <br> Third-party alarm rollback for AWS AppConfig is available in all AWS Regions, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

<h4 id="aws-application-load-balancer-introduces-header-modification-for-enhanced-traffic-control-and-security-1">AWS Application Load Balancer introduces header modification for enhanced traffic control and security</h4>
<p>Application Load Balancer (ALB) now supports HTTP request and response header modification giving you greater controls to manage your application’s traffic and security posture without having to alter your application code.<br> <br> This feature introduces three key capabilities: renaming specific load balancer generated headers, inserting specific response headers, and disabling server response header. With header rename, you can now rename all ALB generated Transport Layer Security (TLS) headers that the load balancer adds to requests, which includes the six mTLS headers and two TLS headers (version and cipher). This capability enables seamless integration with existing applications that expect headers in a specific format, thereby minimizing changes to your backends while using TLS features on the ALB. With header insertion, you can insert custom headers related to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and critical security headers like HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS). Finally, the capability to disable the ALB generated “Server” header in responses reduces exposure of server-specific information, adding an extra layer of protection to your application. These response header modification features give you the ability to centrally enforce your organizations security posture at the load balancer instead of enforcement at individual applications, which can be prone to errors.<br> <br> You can configure Header Modification feature using AWS APIs, AWS CLI, or the AWS Management Console.

<h4 id="amazon-ec2-now-provides-lineage-information-for-your-amis-1">Amazon EC2 now provides lineage information for your AMIs</h4>
<p>Amazon EC2 now provides source details for your Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). With this lineage information, you can easily trace any copied or derived AMI back to their original AMI source.<br> <br> Prior to today, you had to maintain a list of AMIs, use tags, and create custom scripts to track the origins of an AMI. This approach was time-consuming, hard to scale, and resulted in operational overheads. Now with this capability, you can easily view details of the source AMI, making it easier for you to understand from where a particular AMI originated. When copying AMIs across AWS Regions, the lineage information clearly links the copied AMIs to their original AMIs. This new capability provides a more streamlined and efficient way to manage and understand the lineage of AMIs within your AWS environment<br> <br> You can view these details by using the AWS CLI, SDKs, or Console. This capability is available at no additional cost in all AWS Regions, including AWS GovCloud (US) and AWS China Regions.

<h4 id="aws-announces-support-for-predictive-scaling-for-amazon-ecs-services-1">AWS announces support for predictive scaling for Amazon ECS services</h4>
<p>Today, AWS announces support for predictive scaling for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank">Amazon Elastic Container Service</a> (Amazon ECS). Predictive scaling leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to proactively scale your Amazon ECS services ahead of demand surges, reducing overprovisioning costs while improving application responsiveness and availability.<br> <br> Amazon ECS offers a rich set of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-auto-scaling.html" target="_blank">service auto scaling </a>options, including target tracking and step scaling policies, that automatically adjust task counts in response to observed load, as well as scheduled scaling to manually define rules to adjust capacity for routine demand patterns. Many applications observe recurring patterns of steep demand changes, such as early morning spikes when business resumes, wherein a reactive scaling policy can be slow to respond. Predictive scaling is a new capability that harnesses advanced machine learning algorithms, pre-trained on millions of data points, to proactively scale out ECS services ahead of anticipated demand surges. You can use predictive scaling alongside your existing auto scaling policies, such as target tracking or step scaling, so that your applications scale based on both real-time and historic patterns. You can also choose a “forecast only” mode to evaluate its accuracy and suitability, before enabling it to “forecast and scale“. Predictive scaling enhances responsiveness and availability for applications with recurring demand patterns, while also reducing the operational effort of manually configuring scaling policies and the costs from overprovisioning.</p>  <p>You can use AWS management console, SDK, CLI, CloudFormation, and CDK to configure predictive auto scaling for your ECS services.

<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ecs" target="_blank">Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) </a>now allows you to configure software version consistency for specific containers within your Amazon ECS services.<br> <br> By default, Amazon ECS resolves container image tags to the image digest (SHA256 hash of the image manifest) when you create a new Amazon ECS service or deploy an update to the service. This enforces that all tasks in the service are identical and launched with this image digest(s). However, for certain containers within the task (e.g. telemetry sidecars provided by a 3rd party) customers may prefer to not enforce consistency and intead use a mutable container image tag (e.g. LATEST). Now, you can disable software version consistency for one or more containers in your ECS service by configuring the new versionConsistency attribute in the container definition. ECS applies changes to version consistency when you redeploy your ECS service with the task definition revision.<br> <br> You can disable software version consistency for your Amazon ECS services running on AWS Fargate platform version 1.4.0 or higher and/or version v1.70.0 or higher of the Amazon ECS Agent in all commercial and the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

<p>Amazon OpenSearch Service now enables you to scale a single cluster to 1000 data nodes (1000 hot nodes and/or 750 warm nodes) and enables you to manage 25 petabytes of data (10 Petabytes in hot nodes and further 15 Petabytes in warm nodes). You no longer need to setup multiple clusters for workloads that require more than 200 data nodes or more than 3 Petabytes of data.<br> <br> Today, for workloads of more than 3 to 4 petabytes of data, you need to create multiple clusters in OpenSearch Service. This may have required you to refactor your applications or business logic to work with your workload split across multiple clusters. In addition, every cluster requires its own configuration, management, and monitoring, adding to the operational overhead. With this launch, you can scale a single cluster up to 1000 nodes, or 25 petabytes of data, removing the operational overhead that comes with managing multiple clusters.<br> <br> To scale a cluster beyond 200 nodes, you have to request an increase through Service Quota, after which you can modify your cluster configuration using the AWS Console, AWS CLI, or the AWS SDK. Depending on the size of the cluster, OpenSearch Service will recommend configuration pre-requisites across data nodes, cluster manager nodes, and coordinator nodes. For more information, refer to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/limits.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.<br> <br> The new limits are available to all OpenSearch Service clusters running OpenSearch 2.17 and above in all AWS regions where Amazon OpenSearch Service is available.

<h4 id="aws-iot-core-adds-capabilities-to-enrich-mqtt-messages-and-simplify-permission-management">AWS IoT Core adds capabilities to enrich MQTT messages and simplify permission management</h4>
<p>AWS IoT Core, a managed cloud service that lets you securely connect Internet of Things (IoT) devices to the cloud and manage them at scale, announces two new capabilities - ability to<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/thing-types-propagating-attributes.html" target="_blank"> enrich MQTT messages</a> with additional data and use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/exclusive-thing.html" target="_blank">thing-to-connection association</a> for simplifying permission management. Message enrichment capability enables developers to augment MQTT messages from devices with additional information from thing registry, without modifying their devices. The thing-to-connection association enables mapping an MQTT client to a registry thing, for client IDs that don’t match thing name. This will enable developers to leverage registry information in IoT policies, easily associate device actions to lifecycle events, and utilize existing capabilities like custom cost allocation and resource-specific logging, previously only available for matching client IDs and thing names.<br> <br> To enrich all messages from devices, developers can define a subset of registry attributes as propagating attributes. They can customize their message routing, processing workflows using this appended data. For example, in automotive applications, developers can selectively route messages to the desired backend depending on the appended metadata, such as vehicle make and type stored in thing registry. Additionally, with thing-to-connection association, developers can leverage existing features like using registry metadata in IoT policies, associate AWS IoT Core lifecycle events to a thing, do custom cost allocation through billing groups, and enable resource-specific logging, even if MQTT client ID and thing name differ.<br> <br> These new features are available in all AWS regions where <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/?nc=sn&#x26;loc=2&#x26;dn=3" target="_blank">AWS IoT Core</a> is present.

<h4 id="amazon-keyspaces-for-apache-cassandra-reduces-prices-by-up-to-75-1">Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) reduces prices by up to 75%</h4>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/" target="_blank">Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra)</a> is a scalable, serverless, highly available, and fully managed Apache Cassandra-compatible database service. Effective Today, Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra)<strong> </strong>is reducing prices by up to 75% across several pricing dimensions.<br> <br> Amazon Keyspaces supports both on-demand and provisioned capacity modes for writing and reading data within a Region or across multiple Regions. Keyspaces’ on-demand mode provides a fully serverless experience with pay-as-you-go pricing and automatic scaling, eliminating the need for capacity planning. Many customers choose on-demand mode for its simplicity, enabling them to build modern, serverless applications that can start small and seamlessly scale to millions of requests per second.<br> <br> Amazon Keyspaces has lowered prices for on-demand mode by up to 56% for single-Region and up to 65% for multi-Region usage, and for provisioned mode by up to 13% for single-Region and up to 20% for multi-Region usage. Additionally, to make data deletion more cost-effective, Keyspaces has lowered time-to-live (TTL) delete prices by 75%.

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" target="_blank">Amazon DynamoDB</a> is a serverless, NoSQL, fully managed database with single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. Starting today, we have made Amazon DynamoDB even more cost-effective by reducing prices for on-demand throughput by 50% and global tables by up to 67%.<br> <br> DynamoDB <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/capacity-mode.html#HowItWorks.OnDemand" target="_blank">on-demand mode</a> offers a truly serverless experience with pay-per-request pricing and automatic scaling without the need for capacity planning. Many customers prefer the simplicity of on-demand mode to build modern, serverless applications that can start small and scale to millions of requests per second. While on-demand was previously cost effective for spiky workloads, with this pricing change, most provisioned capacity workloads on DynamoDB will achieve a lower price with on-demand mode. This pricing change is transformative as it makes on-demand the default and recommended mode for most DynamoDB workloads.<br> <br> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GlobalTables.html" target="_blank">Global tables</a> provide a fully managed, multi-active, multi-Region data replication solution that delivers increased resiliency, improved business continuity, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/sla/" target="_blank">99.999% availability</a> for globally distributed applications at any scale. DynamoDB has reduced pricing for multi-Region replicated writes to match the pricing of single-Region writes, simplifying cost modeling for multi-Region applications. For on-demand tables, this price change lowers replicated write pricing by 67%, and for tables using provisioned capacity, replicated write pricing has been reduced by 33%.<br> <br> These pricing changes are already in effect, in all AWS Regions, starting November 1, 2024 and will be automatically reflected in your AWS bill.

<h4 id="aws-launches-user-based-subscription-of-microsoft-remote-desktop-services">AWS launches user-based subscription of Microsoft Remote Desktop Services</h4>
<p>Today, AWS announces the general availability of Microsoft Remote Desktop Services with AWS provided licenses. Customers can now purchase user-based subscription of Microsoft Remote Desktop Services licenses directly from AWS. This new offering provides licensing flexibility and business continuity for customers running graphical user interface (GUI) based applications on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Windows instances.<br> <br> Thousands of customers use Windows Server on Amazon EC2 to host custom applications or independent software vendor (ISV) products that require remote connectivity via Microsoft Remote Desktop Services. Previously, customers had to procure the licenses through various Microsoft licensing agreements. With the AWS provided subscription, customers can now access Microsoft Remote Desktop Services licenses from AWS on a per-user, per-month basis, eliminating the need for separate licensing agreements and reducing operational overhead. Unlike AWS provided Microsoft Office and Visual Studio, customers can continue using their existing Active Directory(s) for managing user access to GUI-based applications on Amazon EC2. Moreover, customers can have more than two concurrent user sessions with Windows Server instances. Lastly, AWS License Manager enables centralized tracking for license usage, simplifying governance and cost management. Customers can start using AWS provided Microsoft Remote Desktop Services licenses without rebuilding their existing Amazon EC2 instances, providing a seamless migration path for existing workloads.<br> <br> AWS provided user-based subscription of Microsoft Remote Desktop Services license is available in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/licensemanager.html#license-manager-user-based-subscriptions_region" target="_blank">all AWS Regions currently License Manager supports</a>.

<h4 id="aws-transit-gateway-and-aws-cloud-wan-enhance-visibility-metrics-and-path-mtu-support-1">AWS Transit Gateway and AWS Cloud WAN enhance visibility metrics and Path MTU support</h4>
<p>AWS Transit Gateway (TGW) and AWS Cloud WAN now support per availability zone (AZ) metrics delivered to CloudWatch. Furthermore, both services now support Path Maximum Transmission Unit Discovery (PMTUD) for effective mitigation against MTU mismatch issues in their global networks.<br> <br> TGW and Cloud WAN allow customers to monitor their global network through performance and traffic metrics such as bytes in/out, packets in/out, and packets dropped. Until now, these metrics were available at an attachment level, and aggregate TGW and Core Network Edge (CNE) levels. With this launch, customers have more granular visibility into AZ-level metrics for VPC attachments. AZ-level metrics enable customers to rapidly troubleshoot any AZ impairments and provide deeper visibility in AZ-level traffic patterns across TGW and Cloud WAN.<br> <br> TGW and Cloud WAN now also support standard PMTUD mechanism for traffic ingressing on VPC attachments. Until now, jumbo sized packets exceeding the TGW/CNE MTU (8500 bytes) would get silently dropped on VPC attachments. With this launch, an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) <em>Fragmentation Needed</em> response message is sent back to sender hosts allowing them to remediate packet MTU size and thus minimize packet loss due to MTU mismatches in their network. PMTUD support is available for both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.<br> <br> The per-AZ CloudWatch metrics and PMTUD support are available within each service in all AWS Regions where TGW or Cloud WAN are available.

<h4 id="get-x-ray-vision-into-aws-cloudformation-deployments-with-a-timeline-view-1">Get x-ray vision into AWS CloudFormation deployments with a timeline view</h4>
<p>AWS CloudFormation now offers a capability called deployment timeline view that allows customers to monitor and visualize the sequence of actions CloudFormation takes in a stack operation. This capability provides visibility into the ordering and duration of resource provisioning actions for a stack operation. This empowers developers to optimize their CloudFormation templates and speed up troubleshooting of deployment issues.<br> <br> When you create, update, or delete a stack, CloudFormation initiates resource-level provisioning actions based on a resource dependency graph. For example, if you submit a CloudFormation template with an EC2 instance, Security Group, and VPC, CloudFormation creates the VPC, Security Group, and EC2 instance in that order. Previously, you could only see the chronological list of stack operation events, which provided limited visibility into dependencies between resources and the ordering of provisioning actions. Now, you can see a graphical visualization that shows the order in which CloudFormation provisions resources within a stack, color-coding the status of each resource, and the duration of each provisioning action. If a resource provisioning encounters an error, it highlights the likely root cause. This allows you to determine the optimal grouping of resources into templates, for minimizing deployment times and improving maintainability.<br> <br> The new capability is available in all AWS Regions where CloudFormation is supported. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/cfn.html#cfn_region" target="_blank">AWS Region table</a> for service availability details.<br> <br> Get started by initiating a stack operation and accessing the deployment timeline view from the stack events tab in the CloudFormation Console.

Enhanced event filtering expands upon existing filtering capabilities, giving you even greater control over which CloudTrail events are ingested into your event data stores. This enhancement increases the efficiency and precision of your security, compliance, and operational investigations while helping reduce costs.<br> <br> You can now filter both management and data events by the following new attributes:</p>  <ul> 	<li><u>eventSource:</u> The service that the request was made to</li> 	<li><u>eventType:</u> Type of event that generated the event record (e.g., AwsApiCall, AwsServiceEvent, etc)</li> 	<li><u>userIdentity.arn:</u> IAM entity that made the request</li> 	<li><u>sessionCredentialFromConsole:</u> Whether the event originated from an AWS Management Console session or not</li> </ul>  <p>For management events, you can additionally filter by eventName which identifies the requested API action.<br> <br> For each of these attributes, you can specify values to include or exclude. For example, you can now filter CloudTrail events based on the userIdentity.arn attribute to exclude events generated by specific IAM roles or users. You can exclude a dedicated IAM role used by a service that performs frequent API calls for monitoring purposes. This allows you to significantly reduce the volume of CloudTrail events ingested into CloudTrail Lake, lowering costs while maintaining visibility into relevant user and system activities.<br> <br> Enhanced event filtering is available in all AWS Regions where AWS CloudTrail Lake is supported, at no additional charge.

<p>Starting today, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> now supports <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/">AWS PrivateLink </a>in the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. With IAM, you can specify who or what can access services and resources in AWS by creating and managing resources such as IAM roles and policies. You can now establish a private connection between your virtual private cloud (VPC) and IAM to manage IAM resources, helping you meet your compliance and regulatory requirements to limit public internet connectivity.<br> <br> By using PrivateLink with both IAM and the AWS Security Token Service (STS), which already supports PrivateLink, you can now manage your IAM resources such as IAM roles and request temporary credentials to access your AWS resources end to end without going through the public Internet. Interface VPC endpoints for IAM in the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions can only be created in the AWS GovCloud (US-West) Region, where the IAM control plane is located. If your VPC is in a different Region, use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/" target="_blank">AWS Transit Gateway </a>to allow access to the IAM interface VPC endpoint from another Region.<br> <br> For more information about AWS PrivateLink and IAM, please see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_interface_vpc_endpoints.html" target="_blank">IAM User Guide</a>.</p>

<h4 id="amazon-verified-permissions-launches-new-api-to-get-multiple-policies-1">Amazon Verified Permissions launches new API to get multiple policies</h4>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/verified-permissions" target="_blank">Amazon Verified Permissions</a> has launched a new API called batchGetPolicies. Customers can now make a single API call that returns multiple policies, for example to populate a list of policies that apply to a specific principal or resource. Amazon Verified Permissions is a permissions management and fine-grained authorization service for the applications that you build. Amazon Verified Permissions uses the <a href="https://cedarpolicy.com/" target="_blank">Cedar</a> policy language to enable developers and admins to define policy-based access controls based on roles and attributes. For example, a patient management application might call Amazon Verified Permissions (AVP) to determine if Alice is permitted access to Bob’s patient records.<br> <br> The new API accepts up to 100 policy IDs and returns the corresponding set of policies, from across one or more policy stores. This simplifies the integration and reduces latency. Using the API reduces the number of calls that an application needs to make to Verified Permissions. For example, when building a permissions management UX that lists Cedar policies, the application now needs to make only one call to get 50 policies, rather than making 50 calls.<br> <br> This feature is available in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank">all regions</a> where Verified Permissions is available. Pricing is based on the number of policies requested.

<h4 id="introducing-resource-control-policies-rcps-to-centrally-restrict-access-to-aws-resources">Introducing resource control policies (RCPs) to centrally restrict access to AWS resources</h4>
<p>AWS is excited to announce resource control policies (RCPs) in AWS Organizations to help you centrally establish a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/identity/data-perimeters-on-aws/" target="_blank">data perimeter</a> across your AWS environment. With RCPs, you can centrally restrict external access to your AWS resources at scale. At launch, RCPs apply to resources of the following AWS services: Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), AWS Security Token Service, AWS Key Management Service, Amazon Simple Queue Service, and AWS Secrets Manager.<br> <br> RCPs are a type of organization policy that can be used to centrally create and enforce preventative controls on AWS resources in your organization. Using RCPs, you can centrally set the maximum available permissions to your AWS resources as you scale your workloads on AWS. For example, an RCP can help enforce the requirement that “no principal outside my organization can access Amazon S3 buckets in my organization,” regardless of the permissions granted through individual bucket policies. RCPs complement service control policies (SCPs), an existing type of organization policy. While SCPs offer central control over the maximum permissions for IAM roles and users in your organization, RCPs offer central control over the maximum permissions on AWS resources in your organization.<br> <br> Customers that use AWS IAM Access Analyzer to identify external access can review the impact of RCPs on their resource permissions.

<h4 id="aws-iot-core-adds-capabilities-to-enrich-mqtt-messages-and-simplify-permission-management-1">AWS IoT Core adds capabilities to enrich MQTT messages and simplify permission management</h4>
<p>AWS IoT Core, a managed cloud service that lets you securely connect Internet of Things (IoT) devices to the cloud and manage them at scale, announces two new capabilities - ability to<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/thing-types-propagating-attributes.html" target="_blank"> enrich MQTT messages</a> with additional data and use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/exclusive-thing.html" target="_blank">thing-to-connection association</a> for simplifying permission management. Message enrichment capability enables developers to augment MQTT messages from devices with additional information from thing registry, without modifying their devices. The thing-to-connection association enables mapping an MQTT client to a registry thing, for client IDs that don’t match thing name. This will enable developers to leverage registry information in IoT policies, easily associate device actions to lifecycle events, and utilize existing capabilities like custom cost allocation and resource-specific logging, previously only available for matching client IDs and thing names.<br> <br> To enrich all messages from devices, developers can define a subset of registry attributes as propagating attributes. They can customize their message routing, processing workflows using this appended data. For example, in automotive applications, developers can selectively route messages to the desired backend depending on the appended metadata, such as vehicle make and type stored in thing registry. Additionally, with thing-to-connection association, developers can leverage existing features like using registry metadata in IoT policies, associate AWS IoT Core lifecycle events to a thing, do custom cost allocation through billing groups, and enable resource-specific logging, even if MQTT client ID and thing name differ.<br> <br> These new features are available in all AWS regions where <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/?nc=sn&#x26;loc=2&#x26;dn=3" target="_blank">AWS IoT Core</a> is present.

<p>AWS Lambda announces Provisioned Mode for event source mappings (ESMs) that subscribe to Apache Kafka event sources, a feature that allows you to optimize the throughput of your Kafka ESM by provisioning event polling resources that remain ready to handle sudden spikes in traffic. Provisioned Mode helps you build highly responsive and scalable event-driven Kafka applications with stringent performance requirements.<br> <br> Customers building streaming data applications often use Kafka as an event source for Lambda functions, and use Lambda's fully-managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-msk.html" target="_blank">MSK ESM</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-kafka.html" target="_blank">self-managed Kafka ESM</a>, which automatically scale polling resources in response to events. However, for event-driven Kafka applications that need to handle unpredictable bursts of traffic, lack of control over the throughput of ESM can lead to delays in your users’ experience. Provisioned Mode for Kafka ESM allows you to fine-tune the throughput of the ESM by provisioning and auto-scaling between a minimum and maximum number of polling resources called event pollers, and is ideal for real-time applications with stringent performance requirements.<br> <br> This feature is generally available in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank">AWS Commercial Regions</a> where AWS Lambda is available, except Israel (Tel Aviv), Asia Pacific (Malaysia), and Canada West (Calgary).<br> <br> You can activate Provisioned Mode for MSK ESM or self-managed Kafka ESM by configuring a minimum and maximum number of event pollers in the ESM API, AWS Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDK, AWS CloudFormation, and AWS SAM.

<h4 id="announcing-new-amazon-cloudwatch-metrics-for-aws-lambda-event-source-mappings-esms-1">Announcing new Amazon CloudWatch Metrics for AWS Lambda Event Source Mappings (ESMs)</h4>
<p>AWS Lambda announces new Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Lambda Event Source Mappings (ESMs), which provide customers visibility into the processing state of events read by ESMs that subscribe to Amazon SQS, Amazon Kinesis, and Amazon DynamoDB event sources. This enables customers to easily monitor issues or delays in event processing and take corrective actions.<br> <br> Customers use ESMs to read events from event sources and invoke Lambda functions. Lack of visibility into processing state of events ingested by ESMs delays diagnosis of event processing issues. Customers can now use the following CloudWatch metrics to monitor the processing state of events ingested by ESMs — PolledEventCount, InvokedEventCount, FilteredOutEventCount, FailedInvokeEventCount, DeletedEventCount, DroppedEventCount, and OnFailureDestinationDeliveredEventCount. <em>PolledEventCount</em> counts the events read by an ESM, and <em>InvokedEventCount</em> counts the events that invoked a Lambda function.<em> FilteredOutEventCount</em> counts the events filtered out by an ESM. <em>FailedInvokeEventCount </em>counts the events that attempted to invoke a Lambda function, but encountered failure. <em>DeletedEventCount</em> counts the events that have been deleted from the SQS queue by Lambda upon successful processing. <em>DroppedEventCount </em>counts the events dropped due to event expiry or exhaustion of retry attempts. <em>OnFailureDestinationDeliveredEventCount</em> counts the events successfully sent to an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/kinesis-on-failure-destination.html" target="_blank">on-failure destination</a>.<br> <br> This feature is generally available in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank">AWS Commercial Regions</a> where AWS Lambda is available.<br> <br> You can enable ESM metrics using Lambda event source mapping API, AWS Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDK, AWS CloudFormation, and AWS SAM.

This enables customers to route the failed batch of records and function execution results to S3 using a simple configuration, without the overhead of writing and managing additional code.<br> <br> Customers building event-driven applications with asynchronous event sources or stream event sources for Lambda can configure services like Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) and Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) as failed-event destinations to store the results of failed invocations. However, in scenarios where existing failed-event destinations do not support the payload size requirements for the failed events, customers need to write custom logic to retrieve and redrive event payload data. With today’s announcement, customers can configure S3 as a failed-event destination for Lambda functions invoked via asynchronous invocations, Kinesis ESMs, and DynamoDB ESMs. This enables customers to deliver complete event payload data to the failed-event destination, and helps reduce the overhead of managing custom logic to reliably retrieve and redrive failed event data.<br> <br> This feature is generally available in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank">AWS Commercial Regions</a> where AWS Lambda and the configured event source or event destination are available.<br> <br> To enable S3 as a failed-event destination, refer to our documentation for configuring destinations with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async-retain-records.html" target="_blank">asynchronous invocations</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/kinesis-on-failure-destination.html" target="_blank">Kinesis ESMs</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-dynamodb-errors.html" target="_blank">DynamoDB ESMs</a>.

<h4 id="aws-lambda-supports-customer-managed-key-cmk-encryption-for-zip-function-code-artifacts">AWS Lambda supports Customer Managed Key (CMK) encryption for Zip function code artifacts</h4>
<p>AWS Lambda now supports encryption of Lambda function Zip code artifacts using customer managed keys instead of default AWS owned keys. Using keys that they create, own, and manage can satisfy customer’s organizational security and governance requirements.<br> <br> AWS Lambda is widely adopted for its simple programming model, built-in event triggers, automatic scaling, and fault tolerance. Previously, Lambda supported customer-managed AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key-based encryption for the configuration data stored inside Lambda, such as function environment variables and SnapStart-enabled function snapshots. With today’s launch, customers can provide their own key to encrypt function code in Zip artifacts, making it easy to audit or control access to the code deployed in the Lambda function.<br> <br> Customers can encrypt new or existing function Zip code artifacts by supplying a KMS key when creating or updating a function using AWS Lambda API, AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDK, AWS CloudFormation, or AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM). When the KMS key is disabled, Lambda service and any users using GetFunction API to fetch deployment package will no longer have access to the Zip artifacts deployed with the Lambda function, thus, providing a convenient revocation control to the customers. If no key is provided, Lambda still secures the Zip code artifacts with AWS-managed encryption.<br> <br> This feature is available in all AWS Regions where Lambda is available, except the China Regions.

JSON format allows logs to be structured as a series of key-value pairs, enabling you to quickly search, filter, and analyze large volumes of logs to easily troubleshoot failures and understand the performance of your Lambda functions.<br> <br> We previously announced support for natively capturing application logs (logs generated by your Lambda function code) and system logs (logs generated by the Lambda service while executing your function code) in JSON structured format for Python, Node.js, and Java managed runtimes. However, for .NET managed runtime, you could only natively capture system logs in JSON structured format. To capture application logs in JSON structured format, you had to manually configure logging libraries.

<p>Today, AWS announces the general availability of Microsoft Remote Desktop Services with AWS provided licenses. Customers can now purchase user-based subscription of Microsoft Remote Desktop Services licenses directly from AWS. This new offering provides licensing flexibility and business continuity for customers running graphical user interface (GUI) based applications on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Windows instances.<br> <br> Thousands of customers use Windows Server on Amazon EC2 to host custom applications or independent software vendor (ISV) products that require remote connectivity via Microsoft Remote Desktop Services. Previously, customers had to procure the licenses through various Microsoft licensing agreements. With the AWS provided subscription, customers can now access Microsoft Remote Desktop Services licenses from AWS on a per-user, per-month basis, eliminating the need for separate licensing agreements and reducing operational overhead. Unlike AWS provided Microsoft Office and Visual Studio, customers can continue using their existing Active Directory(s) for managing user access to GUI-based applications on Amazon EC2. Moreover, customers can have more than two concurrent user sessions with Windows Server instances. Lastly, AWS License Manager enables centralized tracking for license usage, simplifying governance and cost management.

<h4 id="amazon-web-services-announces-declarative-policies-3">Amazon Web Services announces declarative policies</h4>
<p>Today, AWS announces the general availability of declarative policies, a new management policy type within AWS Organizations. These policies simplify the way customers enforce durable intent, such as baseline configuration for AWS services within their organization. For example, customers can configure EC2 to allow instance launches using AMIs vended by specific providers and block public access in their VPC with a few simple clicks or commands for their entire organization using declarative policies.<br> <br> Declarative policies are designed to prevent actions that are non-compliant with the policy. The configuration defined in the declarative policy is maintained even when services add new APIs or features, or when customers add new principals or accounts to their organization. With declarative policies, governance teams have access to the account status report which provides insight into the current configuration for an AWS service across their organization. This helps them asses readiness to enforce configuration at scale. Administrators can provide additional transparency to end users by configuring custom error messages to redirect them to internal wikis or ticketing systems through declarative policies.<br> <br> To get started, navigate to the AWS Organizations console to create and attach declarative policies. You can also use AWS Control Tower, AWS CLI or CloudFormation templates to configure these policies. Declarative policies today support EC2, EBS and VPC configurations with support for other services coming soon. To learn more see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_declarative.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/simplify-governance-with-declarative-policies" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>

This service offers automated monitoring and investigation of security findings to free up your resources from routine tasks, communication and collaboration features to streamline response coordination, and direct 24/7 access to the AWS Customer Incident Response Team (CIRT).</p>  <p>Security Incident Response integrates with existing detection services, such as Amazon GuardDuty, and third-party tools through AWS Security Hub to rapidly review security alerts, escalate high-priority findings, and, with your permission, implement containment actions. It reduces the number of alerts your team needs to analyze, saving time and allowing your security personnel to focus on strategic initiatives. The service centralizes all incident-related communications, documentation, and actions, making coordinated incident response across internal and external stakeholders possible and reducing the time to coordinate from hours to minutes. You can preconfigure incident response team members, set up automatic notifications, manage case permissions, and use communication tools like video conferencing and in-console messaging during security events. By accessing the service through a single, centralized dashboard in the AWS Management Console, you can monitor active cases, review resolved security incident cases, and track key metrics, such as the number of triaged events and mean time to resolution, in real time. If you require specialized expertise, you can connect 24/7 to the AWS CIRT in only one step.</p>  <p>For more information about AWS Regions where Security Incident Response is available, refer to the following service <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-ir/latest/userguide/supported-configs.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</p>  <p>To get started, visit the <a href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/security-ir" target="_blank">Security Incident Response console</a>, and explore the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security-incident-response/" target="_blank">overview page</a> to learn more.

<h4 id="introducing-resource-control-policies-rcps-to-centrally-restrict-access-to-aws-resources-1">Introducing resource control policies (RCPs) to centrally restrict access to AWS resources</h4>
<p>AWS is excited to announce resource control policies (RCPs) in AWS Organizations to help you centrally establish a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/identity/data-perimeters-on-aws/" target="_blank">data perimeter</a> across your AWS environment. With RCPs, you can centrally restrict external access to your AWS resources at scale. At launch, RCPs apply to resources of the following AWS services: Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), AWS Security Token Service, AWS Key Management Service, Amazon Simple Queue Service, and AWS Secrets Manager.<br> <br> RCPs are a type of organization policy that can be used to centrally create and enforce preventative controls on AWS resources in your organization. Using RCPs, you can centrally set the maximum available permissions to your AWS resources as you scale your workloads on AWS. For example, an RCP can help enforce the requirement that “no principal outside my organization can access Amazon S3 buckets in my organization,” regardless of the permissions granted through individual bucket policies. RCPs complement service control policies (SCPs), an existing type of organization policy. While SCPs offer central control over the maximum permissions for IAM roles and users in your organization, RCPs offer central control over the maximum permissions on AWS resources in your organization.<br> <br> Customers that use AWS IAM Access Analyzer to identify external access can review the impact of RCPs on their resource permissions. For an updated list of AWS services that support RCPs, refer to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_rcps.html#rcp-supported-services" target="_blank">list of services supporting RCPs</a>.

<h4 id="find-security-compliance-and-operating-metrics-in-aws-resource-explorer">Find security, compliance, and operating metrics in AWS Resource Explorer</h4>
<p>Today, AWS announced the general availability of a new console experience in AWS Resource Explorer that centralizes resource insights and properties from AWS services. With this release, you now have a single console experience to use simple keyword-based search for your AWS resources, view relevant resource properties, and confidently take action to organize your resources.<br> <br> You can now inspect resource properties, resource-level cost with AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Security Hub findings, AWS Config compliance and configuration history, event timelines with AWS CloudTrail, and a relationship graph showing connected resources. You can also take actions on resources directly from the Resource Explorer console, such as manage tags, add resources to applications, and get additional information about a resource with Amazon Q. For example, now you can use Resource Explorer to search for untagged AWS Lambda functions, inspect the properties and tags of a specific function, examine a relationship graph to see what other resources it is connected to, and tag the function accordingly – all from a single console.<br> <br> Resource Explorer is available at no additional charge, though features such as compliance information and configuration history require use of AWS Config, which is charged separately. These features are available in all AWS Regions where Resource Explorer is generally available. For more information on Resource Explorer, please visit our <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/apireference/Welcome.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>. To learn more about how to configure Resource Explorer for your organization, view our multi-account search <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-service-multi-account.html" target="_blank">getting started guide</a>.</p>

<h4 id="aws-announces-aws-security-incident-response-for-general-availability-2">AWS announces AWS Security Incident Response for general availability</h4>
<p>Today, AWS announces the general availability of AWS Security Incident Response, a new service that helps you prepare for, respond to, and recover from security events. This service offers automated monitoring and investigation of security findings to free up your resources from routine tasks, communication and collaboration features to streamline response coordination, and direct 24/7 access to the AWS Customer Incident Response Team (CIRT).</p>  <p>Security Incident Response integrates with existing detection services, such as Amazon GuardDuty, and third-party tools through AWS Security Hub to rapidly review security alerts, escalate high-priority findings, and, with your permission, implement containment actions. It reduces the number of alerts your team needs to analyze, saving time and allowing your security personnel to focus on strategic initiatives. The service centralizes all incident-related communications, documentation, and actions, making coordinated incident response across internal and external stakeholders possible and reducing the time to coordinate from hours to minutes. You can preconfigure incident response team members, set up automatic notifications, manage case permissions, and use communication tools like video conferencing and in-console messaging during security events. By accessing the service through a single, centralized dashboard in the AWS Management Console, you can monitor active cases, review resolved security incident cases, and track key metrics, such as the number of triaged events and mean time to resolution, in real time. If you require specialized expertise, you can connect 24/7 to the AWS CIRT in only one step.</p>  <p>For more information about AWS Regions where Security Incident Response is available, refer to the following service <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-ir/latest/userguide/supported-configs.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</p>  <p>To get started, visit the <a href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/security-ir" target="_blank">Security Incident Response console</a>, and explore the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security-incident-response/" target="_blank">overview page</a> to learn more.

<p>AWS Transit Gateway (TGW) and AWS Cloud WAN now support per availability zone (AZ) metrics delivered to CloudWatch. Furthermore, both services now support Path Maximum Transmission Unit Discovery (PMTUD) for effective mitigation against MTU mismatch issues in their global networks.<br> <br> TGW and Cloud WAN allow customers to monitor their global network through performance and traffic metrics such as bytes in/out, packets in/out, and packets dropped. Until now, these metrics were available at an attachment level, and aggregate TGW and Core Network Edge (CNE) levels. With this launch, customers have more granular visibility into AZ-level metrics for VPC attachments. AZ-level metrics enable customers to rapidly troubleshoot any AZ impairments and provide deeper visibility in AZ-level traffic patterns across TGW and Cloud WAN.<br> <br> TGW and Cloud WAN now also support standard PMTUD mechanism for traffic ingressing on VPC attachments. Until now, jumbo sized packets exceeding the TGW/CNE MTU (8500 bytes) would get silently dropped on VPC attachments. With this launch, an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) <em>Fragmentation Needed</em> response message is sent back to sender hosts allowing them to remediate packet MTU size and thus minimize packet loss due to MTU mismatches in their network. PMTUD support is available for both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.<br> <br> The per-AZ CloudWatch metrics and PMTUD support are available within each service in all AWS Regions where TGW or Cloud WAN are available.

<h4 id="introducing-amazon-q-apps-with-private-sharing-3">Introducing Amazon Q Apps with private sharing</h4>
<p>Amazon Q Apps, a capability within Amazon Q Business to create lightweight, generative AI-powered apps, now supports private sharing. This new feature enables app creators to restrict app access to select Amazon Q Business users, providing more granular control over app visibility and usage within organizations.<br> <br> Previously, Amazon Q Apps could only be kept private for individual use or published to all users of the Amazon Q Business environment through the Amazon Q Apps library. Now app creators can share their apps with specific individuals allowing for more targeted collaboration and controlled access. App users with access to shared apps can find these apps in the Amazon Q Apps Library and run them. Apps shown in the library respect the access set by the app creator so those are visible only to selected users. Private sharing enables new functional use cases. For instance, a messaging-compliant document generation app may be shared company-wide for anyone in the organization to use, while a customer outreach app could be restricted to individuals of the sales team only. Private sharing also opens up possibilities for app creators to gather early feedback from a small group of users before wider distribution of their app.<br> <br> Amazon Q Apps with private sharing is now available in the same regions where Amazon Q Business is available.<br> <br> To learn more about private sharing in Amazon Q Apps, visit the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/qapps-private-sharing.html" target="_blank">Q Apps documentation</a>.</p>

The configuration defined in the declarative policy is maintained even when services add new APIs or features, or when customers add new principals or accounts to their organization. With declarative policies, governance teams have access to the account status report which provides insight into the current configuration for an AWS service across their organization. This helps them asses readiness to enforce configuration at scale. Administrators can provide additional transparency to end users by configuring custom error messages to redirect them to internal wikis or ticketing systems through declarative policies.<br> <br> To get started, navigate to the AWS Organizations console to create and attach declarative policies. You can also use AWS Control Tower, AWS CLI or CloudFormation templates to configure these policies. Declarative policies today support EC2, EBS and VPC configurations with support for other services coming soon.

<h4 id="amazon-ec2-introduces-allowed-amis-to-enhance-ami-governance-2">Amazon EC2 introduces Allowed AMIs to enhance AMI governance</h4>
<p>Amazon EC2 introduces Allowed AMIs, a new account-wide setting that enables you to limit the discovery and use of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) within your AWS accounts. You can now simply specify the AMI owner accounts or AMI owner aliases permitted within your account, and only AMIs from these owners will be visible and available to you to launch EC2 instances.<br> <br> Prior to today, you could use any AMI explicitly shared with your account or any public AMI, regardless of its origin or trustworthiness, putting you at risk of accidentally using an AMI that didn’t meet your organization's compliance requirements. Now with Allowed AMIs, your administrators can specify the accounts or owner aliases whose AMIs are permitted for discovery and use within your AWS environment. This streamlined approach provides guardrails to reduce the risk of inadvertently using non-compliant or unauthorized AMIs. Allowed AMIs also supports an audit-mode functionality to identify EC2 instances launched using AMIs not permitted by this setting, helping you identify non-compliant instances before the setting is applied. You can apply this setting across AWS Organizations and Organizational Units using Declarative Policies, allowing you to manage and enforce this setting at scale.<br> <br> Allowed AMI setting only applies to public AMIs and AMIs explicitly shared with your AWS accounts. By default, this setting is disabled for all AWS accounts. You can enable it by using the AWS CLI, SDKs, or Console. To learn more, please visit our <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-allowed-amis.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</p>

<h4 id="announcing-amazon-eks-auto-mode-1">Announcing Amazon EKS Auto Mode</h4>
<p>Today at re:Invent, AWS announced Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) Auto Mode, a new feature that fully automates compute, storage, and networking management for Kubernetes clusters. Amazon EKS Auto Mode simplifies running Kubernetes by offloading cluster operations to AWS, improves the performance and security of your applications, and helps optimize compute costs. </p>  <p>You can use EKS Auto Mode to get Kubernetes conformant managed compute, networking, and storage for any new or existing EKS cluster. This makes it easier for you to leverage the security, scalability, availability, and efficiency of AWS for your Kubernetes applications. EKS Auto Mode removes the need for deep expertise, ongoing infrastructure management, or capacity planning by automatically selecting the best EC2 instances to run your application. It helps optimize compute costs while maintaining application availability by dynamically scaling EC2 instances based on demand. EKS Auto Mode provisions, operates, secures, and upgrades EC2 instances within your account using AWS-controlled access and lifecycle management. It handles OS patches and updates and limits security risks with ephemeral compute, which strengthens your security posture by default.</p>  <p>EKS Auto Mode is available today in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank">AWS Regions</a>, except AWS GovCloud (US) and China Regions. You can enable EKS Auto Mode in any EKS cluster running Kubernetes 1.29 and above with no upfront fees or commitments—you pay for the management of the compute resources provisioned, in addition to your regular EC2 costs. </p>  <p>To get started with EKS Auto Mode, use the EKS API, AWS Console, or your favorite infrastructure as code tooling to enable it in a new or existing EKS cluster.

<h4 id="neptune-analytics-adds-support-for-customer-managed-privatelink-endpoints-1">Neptune Analytics Adds Support for Customer Managed PrivateLink endpoints</h4>
<p>Today, we’re introducing a new feature for Neptune Analytics that allows customers to easily provision Amazon VPC interface endpoints (interface endpoints) in their Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). These endpoints provide direct access from on-premises applications over VPN or AWS Direct Connect, and across AWS Regions via VPC peering. With this feature, network engineers can create and manage VPC resources centrally. By leveraging AWS PrivateLink and interface endpoints, development teams can now establish private, secure network connectivity from their applications to Neptune Analytics with simplified configuration.<br> <br> Previously, development teams had to manually configure complex network settings, leading to operational overhead and potential misconfigurations that could affect security and connectivity. With AWS PrivateLink support for Neptune Analytics, customers can now streamline private connectivity between VPCs, Neptune Analytics, and on-premises data centers using interface endpoints and private IP addresses. This approach simplifies this process by allowing central teams to create and manage PrivateLink endpoints and development teams to utilize those PrivateLink endpoints for their graphs without needing to manage them directly. This launch allows developers to concentrate on graph load, thereby reducing time-to-value and simplifying overall management.<br> <br> Please see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/pricing/" target="_blank">AWS PrivateLink pricing</a> for the cost details. You can get started with the feature by using AWS API, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK.<br>  </p>

<h4 id="introducing-advanced-scaling-in-amazon-emr-managed-scaling-2">Introducing Advanced Scaling in Amazon EMR Managed Scaling</h4>
<p>We are excited to announce Advanced Scaling, a new capability in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/introducing-amazon-emr-managed-scaling-automatically-resize-clusters-to-lower-cost/" target="_blank">Amazon EMR Managed Scaling</a> which provides customers increased flexibility to control the performance and resource utilization of their Amazon EMR on EC2 clusters. With Advanced Scaling, customers will be able to configure the desired resource utilization or performance levels for their cluster, and Amazon EMR Managed Scaling will leverage the customers intent to intelligently scale the cluster and optimize cluster compute resources.<br> <br> Customers appreciate the simplicity of Amazon EMR Managed Scaling. However, there are instances where the default Amazon EMR Managed Scaling algorithm might lead to cluster under-utilization for specific customer’s workload. For instance, clusters running multiple tasks of relatively short duration (task runtime of 10 seconds or less), Amazon EMR Managed Scaling by default scales up the cluster aggressively and conservatively scale it down to avoid negative impact to job run times. While this is the right approach for SLA-sensitive workloads, it might not be optimal for cost sensitive workloads. With Advanced Scaling, customer can now configure Amazon EMR Managed Scaling behavior suitable for their workload type and we will apply tailored optimization to intelligently add or remove nodes from the clusters.<br> <br> To get started with Advanced Scaling, you can set the ScalingStrategy and UtilizationPerformanceIndex parameters either when creating a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/APIReference/API_PutManagedScalingPolicy.html" target="_blank">new</a> Managed Scaling policy, or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/APIReference/API_PutManagedScalingPolicy.html" target="_blank">updating</a> an existing Managed Scaling policy. Advanced Scaling is available with Amazon EMR release 7.0 and later and is available in all regions where Amazon EMR Managed Scaling is available. For more details, please refer to our <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/managed-scaling-allocation-strategy-optimized.html" target="_blank">Advanced Scaling documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Starting today, EC2 Auto Scaling and EC2 Fleet customers can express their EC2 instances’ CPU-performance requirements as part of the Attribute-Based Instance Type Selection (ABIS) configuration. With ABIS, customers can already choose a list of instances types by defining a set of desired resource requirements, such as the number of vCPU cores and memory per instance. Now, in addition to the quantitative resource requirements, customers can also identify an instance family that ABIS will use as a baseline to automatically select instance types that offer similar or better CPU performance, enabling customers to further optimize their instance-type selection.<br> <br> ABIS is a powerful tool for customers looking to leverage instance type diversification to meet their capacity requirements. For example, customers who use Spot Instances to launch into limited EC2 spare capacity for a discounted price, access multiple instance types to successfully fulfill their larger capacity needs and experience fewer interruptions. With this release, for example, customers can use ABIS in a launch request for instances that can be in the C, M, and R instance classes, with a minimum of 4 vCPUs, and provide CPU performance in line with the C6i instance family, or better.<br> <br> The feature is available in all AWS commercial and the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. You can use Amazon Management Console, CLI, SDKs, and CloudFormation to update your instance requirements.

<p>Today, AWS announces support for predictive scaling for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank">Amazon Elastic Container Service</a> (Amazon ECS). Predictive scaling leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to proactively scale your Amazon ECS services ahead of demand surges, reducing overprovisioning costs while improving application responsiveness and availability.<br> <br> Amazon ECS offers a rich set of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-auto-scaling.html" target="_blank">service auto scaling </a>options, including target tracking and step scaling policies, that automatically adjust task counts in response to observed load, as well as scheduled scaling to manually define rules to adjust capacity for routine demand patterns. Many applications observe recurring patterns of steep demand changes, such as early morning spikes when business resumes, wherein a reactive scaling policy can be slow to respond. Predictive scaling is a new capability that harnesses advanced machine learning algorithms, pre-trained on millions of data points, to proactively scale out ECS services ahead of anticipated demand surges. You can use predictive scaling alongside your existing auto scaling policies, such as target tracking or step scaling, so that your applications scale based on both real-time and historic patterns. You can also choose a “forecast only” mode to evaluate its accuracy and suitability, before enabling it to “forecast and scale“. Predictive scaling enhances responsiveness and availability for applications with recurring demand patterns, while also reducing the operational effort of manually configuring scaling policies and the costs from overprovisioning.</p>  <p>You can use AWS management console, SDK, CLI, CloudFormation, and CDK to configure predictive auto scaling for your ECS services.

<h4 id="aws-lambda-supports-amazon-s3-as-a-failed-event-destination-for-asynchronous-and-stream-event-sources-2">AWS Lambda supports Amazon S3 as a failed-event destination for asynchronous and stream event sources</h4>
<p>AWS Lambda now supports Amazon S3 as a failed-event <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-destinations/" target="_blank">destination</a> for asynchronous invocations, and for Amazon Kinesis and Amazon DynamoDB event source mappings (ESMs). This enables customers to route the failed batch of records and function execution results to S3 using a simple configuration, without the overhead of writing and managing additional code.<br> <br> Customers building event-driven applications with asynchronous event sources or stream event sources for Lambda can configure services like Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) and Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) as failed-event destinations to store the results of failed invocations. However, in scenarios where existing failed-event destinations do not support the payload size requirements for the failed events, customers need to write custom logic to retrieve and redrive event payload data. With today’s announcement, customers can configure S3 as a failed-event destination for Lambda functions invoked via asynchronous invocations, Kinesis ESMs, and DynamoDB ESMs. This enables customers to deliver complete event payload data to the failed-event destination, and helps reduce the overhead of managing custom logic to reliably retrieve and redrive failed event data.<br> <br> This feature is generally available in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank">AWS Commercial Regions</a> where AWS Lambda and the configured event source or event destination are available.<br> <br> To enable S3 as a failed-event destination, refer to our documentation for configuring destinations with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async-retain-records.html" target="_blank">asynchronous invocations</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/kinesis-on-failure-destination.html" target="_blank">Kinesis ESMs</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-dynamodb-errors.html" target="_blank">DynamoDB ESMs</a>.

<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ecs" target="_blank">Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) </a>now allows you to configure software version consistency for specific containers within your Amazon ECS services.<br> <br> By default, Amazon ECS resolves container image tags to the image digest (SHA256 hash of the image manifest) when you create a new Amazon ECS service or deploy an update to the service. This enforces that all tasks in the service are identical and launched with this image digest(s). However, for certain containers within the task (e.g. telemetry sidecars provided by a 3rd party) customers may prefer to not enforce consistency and intead use a mutable container image tag (e.g. LATEST). Now, you can disable software version consistency for one or more containers in your ECS service by configuring the new versionConsistency attribute in the container definition. ECS applies changes to version consistency when you redeploy your ECS service with the task definition revision.<br> <br> You can disable software version consistency for your Amazon ECS services running on AWS Fargate platform version 1.4.0 or higher and/or version v1.70.0 or higher of the Amazon ECS Agent in all commercial and the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

<p>Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) zonal shift and zonal autoshift have expanded their capabilities and now support EC2 Auto Scaling. ARC zonal shift helps you quickly recover an unhealthy application in an Availability Zone (AZ), and reduce the duration and severity of impact to the application due to events such as power outages and hardware or software failures. ARC zonal autoshift safely and automatically shifts your application’s traffic away from an AZ when AWS identifies a potential failure affecting that AZ.<br> <br> EC2 Auto Scaling customers can now shift traffic away from an AZ in the event of a failure. Zonal shift works with EC2 Auto Scaling by stopping dynamic scale-in, so that capacity is not unnecessarily removed and launching new EC2 instances in the healthy AZs only. In addition, you can set health checks to enabled in the impaired AZ or disable health checks in the impaired AZ. When disabled, it will pause unhealthy instance replacement in the AZ that has an active zonal shift. Enable your EC2 Auto Scaling Groups for zonal shift using the EC2 Auto Scaling console or API, and then trigger a zonal shift or enable autoshift via ARC zonal shift console or API.

<h4 id="neptune-analytics-adds-support-for-customer-managed-privatelink-endpoints-2">Neptune Analytics Adds Support for Customer Managed PrivateLink endpoints</h4>
<p>Today, we’re introducing a new feature for Neptune Analytics that allows customers to easily provision Amazon VPC interface endpoints (interface endpoints) in their Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). These endpoints provide direct access from on-premises applications over VPN or AWS Direct Connect, and across AWS Regions via VPC peering. With this feature, network engineers can create and manage VPC resources centrally. By leveraging AWS PrivateLink and interface endpoints, development teams can now establish private, secure network connectivity from their applications to Neptune Analytics with simplified configuration.<br> <br> Previously, development teams had to manually configure complex network settings, leading to operational overhead and potential misconfigurations that could affect security and connectivity. With AWS PrivateLink support for Neptune Analytics, customers can now streamline private connectivity between VPCs, Neptune Analytics, and on-premises data centers using interface endpoints and private IP addresses. This approach simplifies this process by allowing central teams to create and manage PrivateLink endpoints and development teams to utilize those PrivateLink endpoints for their graphs without needing to manage them directly. This launch allows developers to concentrate on graph load, thereby reducing time-to-value and simplifying overall management.<br> <br> Please see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/pricing/" target="_blank">AWS PrivateLink pricing</a> for the cost details.

<h4 id="amazon-aurora-serverless-v2-supports-scaling-to-zero-capacity-1">Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 supports scaling to zero capacity</h4>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/" target="_blank">Amazon Aurora Serverless v2</a> now supports scaling to 0 Aurora Capacity Units (ACUs). This launch enables the database to automatically pause after a period of inactivity based on database connections. When the first connection is requested, the database will automatically resume and scale to meet the application demand. Aurora Serverless v2 measures capacity in ACUs where each ACU is a combination of approximately 2 gibibytes (GiB) of memory, corresponding CPU, and networking. You specify the capacity range and the database scales within this range to support your application’s needs.<br> <br> With 0 ACUs, customers can now save cost during periods of database inactivity. Instead of scaling down to 0.5 ACUs, the database can now scale down to 0 ACUs. You can get started with this feature with a new cluster or your existing cluster with just a few clicks in the AWS Management console. For a new cluster, set 0 ACUs for the minimum capacity setting. For existing clusters, update to supported versions and then modify the minimum capacity setting to 0 ACUs. 0 ACUs is supported for Aurora PostgreSQL 13.15+, 14.12+, 15.7+, and 16.3+, and Aurora MySQL 3.08+.<br> <br> Aurora Serverless is an on-demand, automatic scaling configuration for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/" target="_blank">Amazon Aurora</a>. It adjusts capacity in fine-grained increments to provide just the right amount of database resources for an application’s needs.

<h4 id="disk-optimized-vector-engine-now-available-on-the-amazon-opensearch-service-3">Disk-optimized vector engine now available on the Amazon OpenSearch Service</h4>
<p>Amazon OpenSearch's vector engine can now run modern search applications at a third of the cost on OpenSearch 2.17 domains. When you configure a k-NN (vector) index for disk mode, it becomes optimized for operating in a low memory environment. With disk mode on, the index is compressed using techniques like binary quantization and search quality (recall) is retained through a disk-optimized rescoring mechanism using full-precision vectors. Disk-mode is an excellent option for vector search workloads that require high accuracy, cost efficiency and are satisfied by low hundreds-of-milliseconds latency. It provides customers with a lower cost alternative to the existing in-memory mode when <a href="https://opensearch.org/benchmarks" target="_blank">single-digit latency</a> is unnecessary.

<p>Amazon DynamoDB now supports a new warm throughput value and the ability to easily pre-warm DynamoDB tables and indexes. The warm throughput value provides visibility into the number of read and write operations your DynamoDB tables can readily handle, while pre-warming let’s you proactively increase the value to meet future traffic demands.<br> <br> DynamoDB automatically scales to support workloads of virtually any size. However, when you have peak events like product launches or shopping events, request rates can surge 10x or even 100x in a short period of time. You can now check your tables’ warm throughput value to assess if your table can handle large traffic spikes for peak events. If you expect an upcoming peak event to exceed the current warm throughput value for a given table, you can pre-warm that table in advance of the peak event to ensure it scales instantly to meet demand.<br> <br> Warm throughput values are available for all provisioned and on-demand tables and indexes at no cost. Pre-warming your table's throughput incurs a charge. See <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/on-demand/" target="_blank">Amazon DynamoDB Pricing page</a> for pricing details.

With <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/managed-service-apache-flink/" target="_blank">Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink</a>, you can transform and analyze DynamoDB streams data in real time using Apache Flink and integrate applications with other AWS services such as Amazon S3, Amazon OpenSearch, Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka, and more. Apache Flink connectors are software components that move data into and out of an Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink application. You can use the new connector to read data from a DynamoDB stream starting with Apache Flink version 1.19. With Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink there are no servers and clusters to manage, and there is no compute and storage infrastructure to set up.<br> <br> The Apache Flink repo for AWS connectors can be found <a href="https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-stable/docs/connectors/datastream/dynamodb/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h4 id="aws-iot-core-adds-capabilities-to-enrich-mqtt-messages-and-simplify-permission-management-2">AWS IoT Core adds capabilities to enrich MQTT messages and simplify permission management</h4>
<p>AWS IoT Core, a managed cloud service that lets you securely connect Internet of Things (IoT) devices to the cloud and manage them at scale, announces two new capabilities - ability to<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/thing-types-propagating-attributes.html" target="_blank"> enrich MQTT messages</a> with additional data and use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/exclusive-thing.html" target="_blank">thing-to-connection association</a> for simplifying permission management. Message enrichment capability enables developers to augment MQTT messages from devices with additional information from thing registry, without modifying their devices. The thing-to-connection association enables mapping an MQTT client to a registry thing, for client IDs that don’t match thing name. This will enable developers to leverage registry information in IoT policies, easily associate device actions to lifecycle events, and utilize existing capabilities like custom cost allocation and resource-specific logging, previously only available for matching client IDs and thing names.<br> <br> To enrich all messages from devices, developers can define a subset of registry attributes as propagating attributes. They can customize their message routing, processing workflows using this appended data. For example, in automotive applications, developers can selectively route messages to the desired backend depending on the appended metadata, such as vehicle make and type stored in thing registry. Additionally, with thing-to-connection association, developers can leverage existing features like using registry metadata in IoT policies, associate AWS IoT Core lifecycle events to a thing, do custom cost allocation through billing groups, and enable resource-specific logging, even if MQTT client ID and thing name differ.<br> <br> These new features are available in all AWS regions where <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/?nc=sn&#x26;loc=2&#x26;dn=3" target="_blank">AWS IoT Core</a> is present. For more information refer to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-iot.html" target="_blank">developer</a> guide and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/apireference/Welcome.html" target="_blank">API documentation</a>.</p>

<h4 id="amazon-web-services-announces-declarative-policies-5">Amazon Web Services announces declarative policies</h4>
<p>Today, AWS announces the general availability of declarative policies, a new management policy type within AWS Organizations. These policies simplify the way customers enforce durable intent, such as baseline configuration for AWS services within their organization. For example, customers can configure EC2 to allow instance launches using AMIs vended by specific providers and block public access in their VPC with a few simple clicks or commands for their entire organization using declarative policies.<br> <br> Declarative policies are designed to prevent actions that are non-compliant with the policy. The configuration defined in the declarative policy is maintained even when services add new APIs or features, or when customers add new principals or accounts to their organization. With declarative policies, governance teams have access to the account status report which provides insight into the current configuration for an AWS service across their organization. This helps them asses readiness to enforce configuration at scale. Administrators can provide additional transparency to end users by configuring custom error messages to redirect them to internal wikis or ticketing systems through declarative policies.<br> <br> To get started, navigate to the AWS Organizations console to create and attach declarative policies. You can also use AWS Control Tower, AWS CLI or CloudFormation templates to configure these policies. Declarative policies today support EC2, EBS and VPC configurations with support for other services coming soon.

<h4 id="get-x-ray-vision-into-aws-cloudformation-deployments-with-a-timeline-view-2">Get x-ray vision into AWS CloudFormation deployments with a timeline view</h4>
<p>AWS CloudFormation now offers a capability called deployment timeline view that allows customers to monitor and visualize the sequence of actions CloudFormation takes in a stack operation. This capability provides visibility into the ordering and duration of resource provisioning actions for a stack operation. This empowers developers to optimize their CloudFormation templates and speed up troubleshooting of deployment issues.<br> <br> When you create, update, or delete a stack, CloudFormation initiates resource-level provisioning actions based on a resource dependency graph. For example, if you submit a CloudFormation template with an EC2 instance, Security Group, and VPC, CloudFormation creates the VPC, Security Group, and EC2 instance in that order. Previously, you could only see the chronological list of stack operation events, which provided limited visibility into dependencies between resources and the ordering of provisioning actions. Now, you can see a graphical visualization that shows the order in which CloudFormation provisions resources within a stack, color-coding the status of each resource, and the duration of each provisioning action. If a resource provisioning encounters an error, it highlights the likely root cause. This allows you to determine the optimal grouping of resources into templates, for minimizing deployment times and improving maintainability.<br> <br> The new capability is available in all AWS Regions where CloudFormation is supported. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/cfn.html#cfn_region" target="_blank">AWS Region table</a> for service availability details.<br> <br> Get started by initiating a stack operation and accessing the deployment timeline view from the stack events tab in the CloudFormation Console.

<p>AWS enhances event filtering in AWS CloudTrail Lake, a managed data lake that helps you capture, immutably store, access, and analyze your activity logs, as well as AWS Config configuration items. Enhanced event filtering expands upon existing filtering capabilities, giving you even greater control over which CloudTrail events are ingested into your event data stores. This enhancement increases the efficiency and precision of your security, compliance, and operational investigations while helping reduce costs.<br> <br> You can now filter both management and data events by the following new attributes:</p>  <ul> 	<li><u>eventSource:</u> The service that the request was made to</li> 	<li><u>eventType:</u> Type of event that generated the event record (e.g., AwsApiCall, AwsServiceEvent, etc)</li> 	<li><u>userIdentity.arn:</u> IAM entity that made the request</li> 	<li><u>sessionCredentialFromConsole:</u> Whether the event originated from an AWS Management Console session or not</li> </ul>  <p>For management events, you can additionally filter by eventName which identifies the requested API action.<br> <br> For each of these attributes, you can specify values to include or exclude. For example, you can now filter CloudTrail events based on the userIdentity.arn attribute to exclude events generated by specific IAM roles or users. You can exclude a dedicated IAM role used by a service that performs frequent API calls for monitoring purposes. This allows you to significantly reduce the volume of CloudTrail events ingested into CloudTrail Lake, lowering costs while maintaining visibility into relevant user and system activities.<br> <br> Enhanced event filtering is available in all AWS Regions where AWS CloudTrail Lake is supported, at no additional charge.

<h4 id="cross-zone-enabled-application-load-balancer-now-supports-zonal-shift-and-zonal-autoshift-2">Cross-zone enabled Application Load Balancer now supports zonal shift and zonal autoshift</h4>
<p>AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) now supports Amazon Application Recovery Controller’s zonal shift and zonal autoshift features on load balancers that are enabled across zones. Zonal shift allows you to quickly shift traffic away from an impaired Availability Zone (AZ) and recover from events such as bad application deployment and gray failures. Zonal autoshift safely and automatically shifts your traffic away from an AZ when AWS identifies potential impact to it.<br> <br> Enabling cross-zone on ALBs is a popular configuration for customers that require an even distribution of traffic across application targets in multiple AZs. With this launch, customers can shift traffic away from an AZ in the event of a failure just like they are able to for cross-zone disabled load balancers. When zonal shift or autoshift is triggered, the ALB will block all traffic to targets in the AZ that is impacted and remove the zonal IP from DNS. You can configure this feature in two steps: First, enable configuration to allow zonal shift to act on your load balancer(s) using the ALB console or API. Second, trigger zonal shift or enable zonal autoshift for the chosen ALBs via Amazon Application Recovery Controller console or API.<br> <br> Zonal shift and zonal autoshift support on ALB is available in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank">all commercial AWS Regions</a>, including the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/" target="_blank">AWS GovCloud (US) Regions</a>.

<h4 id="aws-application-load-balancer-introduces-header-modification-for-enhanced-traffic-control-and-security-2">AWS Application Load Balancer introduces header modification for enhanced traffic control and security</h4>
<p>Application Load Balancer (ALB) now supports HTTP request and response header modification giving you greater controls to manage your application’s traffic and security posture without having to alter your application code.<br> <br> This feature introduces three key capabilities: renaming specific load balancer generated headers, inserting specific response headers, and disabling server response header. With header rename, you can now rename all ALB generated Transport Layer Security (TLS) headers that the load balancer adds to requests, which includes the six mTLS headers and two TLS headers (version and cipher). This capability enables seamless integration with existing applications that expect headers in a specific format, thereby minimizing changes to your backends while using TLS features on the ALB. With header insertion, you can insert custom headers related to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and critical security headers like HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS). Finally, the capability to disable the ALB generated “Server” header in responses reduces exposure of server-specific information, adding an extra layer of protection to your application. These response header modification features give you the ability to centrally enforce your organizations security posture at the load balancer instead of enforcement at individual applications, which can be prone to errors.<br> <br> You can configure Header Modification feature using AWS APIs, AWS CLI, or the AWS Management Console. This feature is available for ALBs in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank">all commercial AWS Regions</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/" target="_blank">AWS GovCloud (US) Regions</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/#AWS_China_Regions*" target="_blank">China Regions</a>.

<h4 id="amazon-application-recovery-controller-zonal-shift-and-zonal-autoshift-support-application-load-balancers-2">Amazon Application Recovery Controller zonal shift and zonal autoshift support Application Load Balancers</h4>
<p>Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) zonal shift and zonal autoshift have expanded their capabilities and now support Application Load Balancers (ALB) with cross-zone configuration enabled. ARC zonal shift helps you quickly recover an unhealthy application in an Availability Zone (AZ), and reduce the duration and severity of impact to the application due to events such as power outages and hardware or software failures. ARC zonal autoshift safely and automatically shifts your application’s traffic away from an AZ when AWS identifies a potential failure affecting that AZ.<br> <br> All ALB customers with cross-zone enabled load balancers can now shift traffic away from an AZ in the event of a failure. Zonal shift works with ALB by blocking all traffic to targets in the impaired AZ and removing the zonal IP from DNS. You need to first enable your ALBs for zonal shift using the ALB console or API, and then trigger a zonal shift or enabled autoshift via ARC zonal shift console or API. Read this launch blog to see how zonal shift can be used with ALB.<br> <br> Zonal shift and zonal autoshift support for ALB with cross-zone configuration enabled is now available in all commercial AWS Regions and the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.<br> <br> There is no additional charge for using zonal shift or zonal autoshift. To get started, visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/application-recovery-controller/" target="_blank">product page</a> or read the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/arc-zonal-shift.resource-types.app-load-balancers.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</p>

<h4 id="aws-announces-media-quality-aware-resiliency-for-live-streaming-3">AWS announces Media Quality-Aware Resiliency for live streaming</h4>
<p>Starting today, you can enable Media Quality-Aware Resiliency (MQAR), an integrated capability between Amazon CloudFront and AWS Media Services that provides dynamic, cross-region origin selection and failover based on a dynamically generated video quality score. Built for customers that need always-on ‘eyes-on-glass’ to deliver live events and 24/7 programming channels, MQAR automatically switches between regions in seconds to recover from video quality degradation in one of the regions. This is designed to help deliver a high quality of experience to viewers.<br> <br> Previously, you could use a CloudFront origin group to failover between two AWS Elemental MediaPackage origins in different AWS Regions based on HTTP error codes. Now with MQAR, your live event streaming workflow has the resiliency to withstand video quality issues including black frames, freeze or dropped frames, or repeated frames. AWS Elemental MediaLive analyzes the video input delivered from the source and dynamically generates a quality score reflecting perceived changes in video quality. Subsequently, your CloudFront distribution continuously selects the MediaPackage origin that reports the highest quality score. You can create CloudWatch alerts to be notified of quality issues using the provided metrics for quality indicators.<br> <br> To get started with MQAR, deploy a cross-region channel delivery using AWS Media Services and configure CloudFront to use MQAR in the origin group. CloudFormation support will be coming soon. There is no additional cost for enabling MQAR, standard pricing applies for CloudFront and AWS Media Services. To learn more about MQAR, refer to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/improve-your-viewers-live-streaming-experience-with-media-quality-aware-resiliency/" target="_blank">launch blog</a> and the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/media-quality-score.html" target="_blank">CloudFront Developer Guide</a>.</p>

<h4 id="amazon-cloudfront-announces-origin-modifications-using-cloudfront-functions-1">Amazon CloudFront announces origin modifications using CloudFront Functions</h4>
<p>Amazon CloudFront now supports origin modification within CloudFront Functions, enabling you to conditionally change or update origin servers on each request. You can now write custom logic in CloudFront Functions to overwrite origin properties, use another origin in your CloudFront distribution, or forward requests to any public HTTP endpoint.<br> <br> Origin modification allows you to create custom routing policies for how traffic should be forwarded to your application servers on cache misses. For example, you can use origin modification to determine the geographic location of a viewer and then forward the request, on cache misses, to the closest AWS Region running your application. This ensures the lowest possible latency for your application. Previously, you had to use AWS Lambda@Edge to modify origins, but now this same capability is available in CloudFront Functions with better performance and lower costs. Origin modification supports updating all existing origin capabilities such as setting custom headers, adjusting timeouts, setting Origin Shield, or changing the primary origin in origin groups.<br> <br> Origin modification is now available within CloudFront Functions at no additional charge. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/helper-functions-origin-modification.html" target="_blank">CloudFront Developer Guide</a>.

<h4 id="amazon-api-gateway-now-supports-custom-domain-name-for-private-rest-apis-2">Amazon API Gateway now supports Custom Domain Name for private REST APIs</h4>
<p>Amazon API Gateway (APIGW) now gives you the ability to manage your private REST APIs using custom user-friendly private DNS name like private.example.com, simplifying API discovery. This feature enhances your security posture by continuing to encrypt your private API traffic with Transport Layer Security (TLS), while providing full control over managing the lifecycle of the TLS certificate associated with your domain.<br> <br> API providers can get started with this feature in four simple steps using APIGW console and/or API(s). First, create a private custom domain. Second, configure an Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) provided or imported certificate for the domain. Third, map multiple private APIs using base path mappings. Fourth, control invokes to the domain using resource policies. API providers can optionally share the domain across accounts using Amazon Resource Access Manager (RAM) to provide consumers the ability to access APIs from different accounts. Once a domain is shared using RAM, a consumer can use VPC endpoint(s) to invoke multiple private custom domains across accounts.<br> <br> Custom domain name for private REST APIs is now available on API Gateway in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank">all AWS Regions,</a> including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

<p>Amazon CloudFront announces enhancements to its standard access logging capabilities, providing customers with new log configuration and delivery options. Customers can now deliver CloudFront access logs directly to two new destinations: Amazon CloudWatch Logs and Amazon Data Firehose. Customers can select from an expanded list of log output formats, including JSON and Apache Parquet (for logs delivered to S3). Additionally, they can directly enable automatic partitioning of logs delivered to S3,<strong> </strong>select specific log fields, and set the order in which they are included in the logs.<br> <br> Until today, customers had to write custom logic to partition logs, convert log formats, or deliver logs to CloudWatch Logs or Data Firehose. The new logging capabilities provide native log configurations, eliminating the need for custom log processing. For example, customers can now directly enable features like Apache Parquet format for CloudFront logs delivered to S3 to improve query performance when using services like Amazon Athena and AWS Glue.<br> <br> Additionally, customers enabling access log delivery to CloudWatch Logs will receive 750 bytes of logs free for each CloudFront request. Standard access log delivery to Amazon S3 remains free.

<h4 id="amazon-cloudfront-now-supports-grpc-delivery-1">Amazon CloudFront now supports gRPC delivery</h4>
<p>Amazon CloudFront now supports delivery for gRPC applications. <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a> is a modern, open-source remote procedure call (RPC) framework that allows bidirectional communication between a client and a server over HTTP/2 connections. Applications built with gRPC benefit from improved latency using efficient bidirectional streaming and a binary message format, called Protocol Buffers, which are smaller than traditional payloads, like JSON used with RESTful APIs<br> <br> gRPC reduces communication latency for applications which require continuous client-server interactions for a responsive user experience. For example, a ride-sharing application can use gRPC service to automatically update the location of the requested vehicles on the user's device without the user having to request updates each time. gRPC addresses some of the latency challenges associated with using REST APIs for bidirectional communication. With REST APIs, clients establish a connection to the server, make a request, receive a response, and then terminate the connection, which introduces extra latency on each request. With gRPC, the client and server can send multiple messages independently and concurrently using a single connection. Using CloudFront to deliver gRPC applications, customers receive the full advantages of gRPC, plus CloudFront's worldwide reach, speed, and security.<br> <br> CloudFront supports gRPC from all edge locations. This excludes Amazon Web Services China (Beijing) region, operated by Sinnet, and the Amazon Web Services China (Ningxia) region, operated by NWCD. Requests and data transfer fees apply to this feature.

<h4 id="aws-announces-block-public-access-for-amazon-virtual-private-cloud-2">AWS announces Block Public Access for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</h4>
<p>Today, AWS announced Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Block Public Access (BPA), a new centralized declarative control that enables network and security administrators to authoritatively block Internet traffic for their VPCs. VPC BPA supersedes any other setting and ensures your VPC resources are protected from unfettered Internet access in compliance with your organizations security and governance policy.<br> <br> Amazon VPC allows customers to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network. Often times customers have thousands of AWS accounts and VPCs that are owned by multiple business units or application developer teams. Central administrators have the critical responsibility to ensure that resources in their VPCs are accessible to the public Internet in a highly controlled fashion. VPC BPA offers a single declarative control that allows admins to easily block Internet access to VPCs via the Internet Gateway or the Egress-only Internet Gateway and ensures that there is no unintended public exposure to their AWS resources regardless of their routing and security configuration. Admins can apply BPA across all or select VPCs in their account, block bi-directional or ingress-only Internet connectivity and exclude select subnets for resources that need Internet access. VPC BPA is integrated with AWS Network Access Analyzer and VPC Flow Logs to support impact analysis, provide advanced visibility and help customers meet audit and compliance requirements.<br> <br> VPC BPA is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon VPC is offered.

<h4 id="amazon-bedrock-guardrails-now-supports-automated-reasoning-checks-preview-2">Amazon Bedrock Guardrails now supports Automated Reasoning checks (Preview)</h4>
<p>With the launch of the Automated Reasoning checks safeguard in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, AWS becomes the first and only major cloud provider to integrate automated reasoning in our generative AI offerings. Automated Reasoning checks help detect hallucinations and provide a verifiable proof that a large language model (LLM) response is accurate. Automated Reasoning tools are not guessing or predicting accuracy. Instead, they rely on sound mathematical techniques to definitively verify compliance with expert-created Automated Reasoning Policies, consequently improving transparency. Organizations increasingly use LLMs to improve user experiences and reduce operational costs by enabling conversational access to relevant, contextualized information. However, LLMs are prone to hallucinations. Due to the ability of LLMs to generate compelling answers, these hallucinations are often difficult to detect. The possibility of hallucinations and an inability to explain why they occurred slows generative AI adoption for use cases where accuracy is critical.<br> <br> With Automated Reasoning checks, domain experts can more easily build specifications called Automated Reasoning Policies that encapsulate their knowledge in fields such as operational workflows and HR policies. Users of Amazon Bedrock Guardrails can validate generated content against an Automated Reasoning Policy to identify inaccuracies and unstated assumptions, and explain why statements are accurate in a verifiable way. For example, you can configure Automated Reasoning checks to validate answers on topics defined in complex HR policies (which can include constraints on employee tenure, location, and performance) and explain why an answer is accurate with supporting evidence.<br> <br> Contact your AWS account team to request access to Automated Reasoning checks in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails in US East (N.

<h4 id="amazon-web-services-announces-declarative-policies-6">Amazon Web Services announces declarative policies</h4>
<p>Today, AWS announces the general availability of declarative policies, a new management policy type within AWS Organizations. These policies simplify the way customers enforce durable intent, such as baseline configuration for AWS services within their organization. For example, customers can configure EC2 to allow instance launches using AMIs vended by specific providers and block public access in their VPC with a few simple clicks or commands for their entire organization using declarative policies.<br> <br> Declarative policies are designed to prevent actions that are non-compliant with the policy. The configuration defined in the declarative policy is maintained even when services add new APIs or features, or when customers add new principals or accounts to their organization. With declarative policies, governance teams have access to the account status report which provides insight into the current configuration for an AWS service across their organization. This helps them asses readiness to enforce configuration at scale. Administrators can provide additional transparency to end users by configuring custom error messages to redirect them to internal wikis or ticketing systems through declarative policies.<br> <br> To get started, navigate to the AWS Organizations console to create and attach declarative policies. You can also use AWS Control Tower, AWS CLI or CloudFormation templates to configure these policies. Declarative policies today support EC2, EBS and VPC configurations with support for other services coming soon. To learn more see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_declarative.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/simplify-governance-with-declarative-policies" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>

<h4 id="introducing-amazon-route-53-resolver-dns-firewall-advanced-3">Introducing Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall Advanced</h4>
<p>Today, AWS announced Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall Advanced, a new set of capabilities on Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall that allow you to monitor and block suspicious DNS traffic associated with advanced DNS threats, such as DNS tunneling and Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs), that are designed to avoid detection by threat intelligence feeds or are difficult for threat intelligence feeds alone to track and block in time.<br> <br> Today, Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall helps you block DNS queries made for domains identified as low-reputation or suspected to be malicious, and to allow queries for trusted domains. With DNS Firewall Advanced, you can now enforce additional protections that monitor and block your DNS traffic in real-time based on anomalies identified in the domain names being queried from your VPCs.<em> </em>To get started, you can configure one or multiple DNS Firewall Advanced rule(s), specifying the type of threat (DGA, DNS tunneling) to be inspected. You can add the rule(s) to a DNS Firewall rule group, and enforce it on your VPCs by associating the rule group to each desired VPC directly or by using AWS Firewall Manager, AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM), AWS CloudFormation, or Route 53 Profiles.<br> <br> Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall Advanced is available in all AWS Regions, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. To learn more about the new capabilities and the pricing, visit the Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/resolver-dns-firewall/" target="_blank">webpage</a> and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/" target="_blank">Route 53 pricing page</a>.

<h4 id="centrally-manage-root-access-in-aws-identity-and-access-management-iam-2">Centrally manage root access in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h4>
<p>Today, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is launching a new capability allowing customers to centrally manage their root credentials, simplify auditing of credentials, and perform tightly scoped privileged tasks across their AWS member accounts managed using AWS Organizations.<br> <br> Now, administrators can remove unnecessary root credentials for member accounts in AWS Organizations and then, if needed, perform tightly scoped privileged actions using temporary credentials. By removing unnecessary credentials, administrators have fewer highly privileged root credentials that they must secure with multi-factor authentication (MFA), making it easier to effectively meet MFA compliance requirements. This helps administrators control highly privileged access in their accounts, reduces operational effort, and makes it easier for them to secure their AWS environment.<br> <br> The capability to manage root access in AWS member accounts is available in all AWS Regions, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and China Regions. To get started managing your root access in IAM, visit the list of resources below:</p>  <ul> 	<li>See <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/centrally-managing-root-access-for-customers-using-aws-organizations" target="_blank">AWS News Blog</a></li> 	<li>Learn more with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html#id_root-user-access-management" target="_blank">AWS Documentation</a></li> 	<li>Get started in <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/organizations/root-access-management" target="_blank">AWS IAM console</a></li> </ul>

<h4 id="introducing-resource-control-policies-rcps-to-centrally-restrict-access-to-aws-resources-2">Introducing resource control policies (RCPs) to centrally restrict access to AWS resources</h4>
<p>AWS is excited to announce resource control policies (RCPs) in AWS Organizations to help you centrally establish a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/identity/data-perimeters-on-aws/" target="_blank">data perimeter</a> across your AWS environment. With RCPs, you can centrally restrict external access to your AWS resources at scale. At launch, RCPs apply to resources of the following AWS services: Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), AWS Security Token Service, AWS Key Management Service, Amazon Simple Queue Service, and AWS Secrets Manager.<br> <br> RCPs are a type of organization policy that can be used to centrally create and enforce preventative controls on AWS resources in your organization. Using RCPs, you can centrally set the maximum available permissions to your AWS resources as you scale your workloads on AWS. For example, an RCP can help enforce the requirement that “no principal outside my organization can access Amazon S3 buckets in my organization,” regardless of the permissions granted through individual bucket policies. RCPs complement service control policies (SCPs), an existing type of organization policy. While SCPs offer central control over the maximum permissions for IAM roles and users in your organization, RCPs offer central control over the maximum permissions on AWS resources in your organization.<br> <br> Customers that use AWS IAM Access Analyzer to identify external access can review the impact of RCPs on their resource permissions. For an updated list of AWS services that support RCPs, refer to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_rcps.html#rcp-supported-services" target="_blank">list of services supporting RCPs</a>.

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/verified-permissions" target="_blank">Amazon Verified Permissions</a> has launched a new API called batchGetPolicies. Customers can now make a single API call that returns multiple policies, for example to populate a list of policies that apply to a specific principal or resource. Amazon Verified Permissions is a permissions management and fine-grained authorization service for the applications that you build. Amazon Verified Permissions uses the <a href="https://cedarpolicy.com/" target="_blank">Cedar</a> policy language to enable developers and admins to define policy-based access controls based on roles and attributes. For example, a patient management application might call Amazon Verified Permissions (AVP) to determine if Alice is permitted access to Bob’s patient records.<br> <br> The new API accepts up to 100 policy IDs and returns the corresponding set of policies, from across one or more policy stores. This simplifies the integration and reduces latency. Using the API reduces the number of calls that an application needs to make to Verified Permissions. For example, when building a permissions management UX that lists Cedar policies, the application now needs to make only one call to get 50 policies, rather than making 50 calls.<br> <br> This feature is available in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank">all regions</a> where Verified Permissions is available.

<h4 id="aws-lambda-announces-provisioned-mode-for-kafka-event-source-mappings-esms-2">AWS Lambda announces Provisioned Mode for Kafka event source mappings (ESMs)</h4>
<p>AWS Lambda announces Provisioned Mode for event source mappings (ESMs) that subscribe to Apache Kafka event sources, a feature that allows you to optimize the throughput of your Kafka ESM by provisioning event polling resources that remain ready to handle sudden spikes in traffic. Provisioned Mode helps you build highly responsive and scalable event-driven Kafka applications with stringent performance requirements.<br> <br> Customers building streaming data applications often use Kafka as an event source for Lambda functions, and use Lambda's fully-managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-msk.html" target="_blank">MSK ESM</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-kafka.html" target="_blank">self-managed Kafka ESM</a>, which automatically scale polling resources in response to events. However, for event-driven Kafka applications that need to handle unpredictable bursts of traffic, lack of control over the throughput of ESM can lead to delays in your users’ experience. Provisioned Mode for Kafka ESM allows you to fine-tune the throughput of the ESM by provisioning and auto-scaling between a minimum and maximum number of polling resources called event pollers, and is ideal for real-time applications with stringent performance requirements.<br> <br> This feature is generally available in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank">AWS Commercial Regions</a> where AWS Lambda is available, except Israel (Tel Aviv), Asia Pacific (Malaysia), and Canada West (Calgary).<br> <br> You can activate Provisioned Mode for MSK ESM or self-managed Kafka ESM by configuring a minimum and maximum number of event pollers in the ESM API, AWS Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDK, AWS CloudFormation, and AWS SAM. You pay for the usage of event pollers, along a billing unit called Event Poller Unit (EPU).

<h4 id="announcing-new-amazon-cloudwatch-metrics-for-aws-lambda-event-source-mappings-esms-2">Announcing new Amazon CloudWatch Metrics for AWS Lambda Event Source Mappings (ESMs)</h4>
<p>AWS Lambda announces new Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Lambda Event Source Mappings (ESMs), which provide customers visibility into the processing state of events read by ESMs that subscribe to Amazon SQS, Amazon Kinesis, and Amazon DynamoDB event sources. This enables customers to easily monitor issues or delays in event processing and take corrective actions.<br> <br> Customers use ESMs to read events from event sources and invoke Lambda functions. Lack of visibility into processing state of events ingested by ESMs delays diagnosis of event processing issues. Customers can now use the following CloudWatch metrics to monitor the processing state of events ingested by ESMs — PolledEventCount, InvokedEventCount, FilteredOutEventCount, FailedInvokeEventCount, DeletedEventCount, DroppedEventCount, and OnFailureDestinationDeliveredEventCount. <em>PolledEventCount</em> counts the events read by an ESM, and <em>InvokedEventCount</em> counts the events that invoked a Lambda function.<em> FilteredOutEventCount</em> counts the events filtered out by an ESM. <em>FailedInvokeEventCount </em>counts the events that attempted to invoke a Lambda function, but encountered failure. <em>DeletedEventCount</em> counts the events that have been deleted from the SQS queue by Lambda upon successful processing. <em>DroppedEventCount </em>counts the events dropped due to event expiry or exhaustion of retry attempts. <em>OnFailureDestinationDeliveredEventCount</em> counts the events successfully sent to an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/kinesis-on-failure-destination.html" target="_blank">on-failure destination</a>.<br> <br> This feature is generally available in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank">AWS Commercial Regions</a> where AWS Lambda is available.<br> <br> You can enable ESM metrics using Lambda event source mapping API, AWS Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDK, AWS CloudFormation, and AWS SAM. To learn more about these metrics, visit <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-metrics-types.html" target="_blank">Lambda developer guide</a>. These new metrics are charged at standard <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/" target="_blank">CloudWatch pricing</a> for metrics.</p>

<h4 id="amazon-s3-adds-new-default-data-integrity-protections-2">Amazon S3 adds new default data integrity protections</h4>
<p>Amazon S3 updates the default behavior of object upload requests with new data integrity protections that build upon S3’s existing durability posture. The latest AWS SDKs now automatically calculate CRC-based checksums for uploads as data is transmitted over the network. S3 independently verifies these checksums and accepts objects after confirming that data integrity was maintained in transit over the public internet. Additionally, S3 now stores a CRC-based whole-object checksum in object metadata, even for multipart uploads, which helps you to verify the integrity of an object stored in S3 at any time.<br> <br> S3 has always validated the integrity of object uploads from the S3 API to storage by calculating MD5 checksums and allowed customers to provide their own pre-calculated MD5 checksums for integrity validation. S3 also supports five additional checksum algorithms, CRC64NVME, CRC32, CRC32C, SHA-1, and SHA-256, for integrity validations on upload and download. Using checksums for data validation is a best practice for data durability, and this new default behavior adds additional data integrity protections with no changes to your applications and at no additional cost.<br> <br> Default checksum protections are rolling out across all AWS Regions in the next few weeks.

<h4 id="amazon-s3-now-supports-enforcement-of-conditional-write-operations-for-s3-general-purpose-buckets-2">Amazon S3 now supports enforcement of conditional write operations for S3 general purpose buckets</h4>
<p>Amazon S3 now supports enforcement of conditional write operations for S3 general purpose buckets using bucket policies. With enforcement of conditional writes, you can now mandate that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/08/amazon-s3-conditional-writes/" target="_blank">S3 check the existence of an object before creating it</a> in your bucket. Similarly, you can also mandate that S3<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/11/amazon-s3-functionality-conditional-writes" target="_blank"> check the state of the object’s content before updating it</a> in your bucket. This helps you to simplify distributed applications by preventing unintentional data overwrites, especially in high-concurrency, multi-writer scenarios.<br> <br> To enforce conditional write operations, you can now use s3:if-none-match or s3:if-match condition keys to write a bucket policy that mandates the use of HTTP if-none-match or HTTP if-match conditional headers in S3 PutObject and CompleteMultipartUpload API requests. With this bucket policy in place, any attempt to write an object to your bucket without the required conditional header will be rejected. You can use this to centrally enforce the use of conditional writes across all the applications that write to your bucket.<br> <br> You can use bucket policies to enforce conditional writes at no additional charge in all AWS Regions. You can use the AWS SDK, API, or CLI to perform conditional writes.

<h4 id="amazon-s3-adds-new-functionality-for-conditional-writes-2">Amazon S3 adds new functionality for conditional writes</h4>
<p>Amazon S3 can now perform conditional writes that evaluate if an object is unmodified before updating it. This helps you coordinate simultaneous writes to the same object and prevents multiple concurrent writers from unintentionally overwriting the object without knowing the state of its content. You can use this capability by providing the ETag of an object using S3 PutObject or CompleteMultipartUpload API requests in both S3 general purpose and directory buckets.<br> <br> Conditional writes simplify how distributed applications with multiple clients concurrently update data across shared datasets. Similar to using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/08/amazon-s3-conditional-writes/" target="_blank">HTTP if-none-match conditional header to check for the existence of an object before creating it</a>, clients can now perform conditional-write checks on an object’s Etag, which reflects changes to the object, by specifying it via the HTTP if-match header in the API request. S3 then evaluates if the object's ETag matches the value provided in the API request before committing the write and prevents your clients from overwriting the object until the condition is satisfied. This new conditional header can help improve the efficiency of your large-scale analytics, distributed machine learning, and other highly parallelized workloads by reliably offloading compare and swap operations to S3.<br> <br> This new conditional-write functionality is available at no additional charge in all AWS Regions. You can use the AWS SDK, API, or CLI to perform conditional writes.

Now, in directory buckets, clients can perform conditional delete checks on an object’s last modified time, size, and Etag using the x-amz-if-match-last-modified-time, x-amz-if-match-size, and HTTP if-match headers, respectively, in the DeleteObject and DeleteObjects API. S3 Express One Zone then evaluates if each of these object attributes match the value provided in these headers and prevents your clients from deleting the object until the condition is satisfied. You can use these headers in conjunction or individually in a delete request to reliably offload object-state evaluation to S3 Express One Zone and efficiently secure your distributed and highly parallelized workloads against unintended deletions.<br> <br> S3 Express One Zone support for conditional deletes is available at no additional charge in all AWS Regions where <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-Endpoints.html" target="_blank">the storage class is available</a>.

With this launch, Mountpoint for S3 can cache data in S3 Express One Zone after it’s read, making the subsequent read requests up to 7x faster compared to reading data from S3 Standard.<br> <br> Previously, Mountpoint for S3 could cache recently accessed data in Amazon EC2 instance storage, EC2 instance memory, or an Amazon EBS volume. This improved performance for repeated read access from the same compute instance for dataset sizes up to the size of the available local storage. Starting today, you can also opt in to caching data in S3 Express One Zone, benefiting applications that repeatedly read a shared dataset across multiple compute instances, without any limits on the total dataset size. Once you opt in, Mountpoint for S3 retains objects with sizes up to one megabyte in S3 Express One Zone. This is ideal for compute-intensive use cases such as machine learning training for computer vision models where applications repeatedly read millions of small images from multiple instances.<br> <br> Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is an open source project backed by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/" target="_blank">AWS support</a>, which means customers with AWS Business and Enterprise Support plans get 24/7 access to cloud support engineers.

<h4 id="announcing-customized-delete-protection-for-amazon-ebs-snapshots-and-ebs-backed-amis-3">Announcing customized delete protection for Amazon EBS Snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs</h4>
<p>Customers can now further customize Recycle Bin rules to exclude EBS Snapshots and EBS-backed Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) based on tags. Customers use Recycle Bin to protect their resources from accidental deletion by retaining them for a time period that customers specify before being permanently deleted. The newly launched feature helps customers save cost by customizing their Recycle Bin rules for delete protection of only critical data in their resources, while excluding non-critical data that do not require delete protection.<br> <br> Creating Region-level retention rules is a simple way to have peace of mind that all EBS Snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs in an AWS Region are protected from accidental deletion by Recycle Bin. However, in some cases, customers have security scanning workflows that create temporary EBS Snapshots that are not used for recovery. Customers may also have backup automation that do not require additional delete protection. The newly added feature to add resource exclusion tags in Recycle Bin can help you reduce storage costs by excluding the resources that do not require deletion protection from moving to Recycle Bin.<br> <br> This feature is now available in all AWS commercial Regions and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. Customers can add exclusion tags to their Recycle Bin rules via EC2 Console, API/CLI, or SDK.</p>  <p>To learn more about using Recycle Bin with exclusion tags, please refer to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/recycle-bin.html" target="_blank">technical documentation</a>.</p>

<p>AWS Lambda now supports Amazon S3 as a failed-event <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-destinations/" target="_blank">destination</a> for asynchronous invocations, and for Amazon Kinesis and Amazon DynamoDB event source mappings (ESMs). This enables customers to route the failed batch of records and function execution results to S3 using a simple configuration, without the overhead of writing and managing additional code.<br> <br> Customers building event-driven applications with asynchronous event sources or stream event sources for Lambda can configure services like Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) and Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) as failed-event destinations to store the results of failed invocations. However, in scenarios where existing failed-event destinations do not support the payload size requirements for the failed events, customers need to write custom logic to retrieve and redrive event payload data. With today’s announcement, customers can configure S3 as a failed-event destination for Lambda functions invoked via asynchronous invocations, Kinesis ESMs, and DynamoDB ESMs. This enables customers to deliver complete event payload data to the failed-event destination, and helps reduce the overhead of managing custom logic to reliably retrieve and redrive failed event data.<br> <br> This feature is generally available in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank">AWS Commercial Regions</a> where AWS Lambda and the configured event source or event destination are available.<br> <br> To enable S3 as a failed-event destination, refer to our documentation for configuring destinations with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async-retain-records.html" target="_blank">asynchronous invocations</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/kinesis-on-failure-destination.html" target="_blank">Kinesis ESMs</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-dynamodb-errors.html" target="_blank">DynamoDB ESMs</a>. This feature incurs no additional charge to use. You pay for charges associated with Amazon S3 usage.</p>
